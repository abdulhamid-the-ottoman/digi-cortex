# 1. Phase I - The Big Picture (Logic Level)


- **Confirm Core Problem, Principle, Solution Idea (from Primer):**
    
    - **Problem:** Computer programs need to store, access, and manage data (both user-facing and internal state) to function effectively. Without this, programs can't represent changes or perform intended tasks.   
        
    - **Principle:** Data can be represented in memory using named locations (for individual items) or structured collections (for multiple related items), allowing for systematic access and manipulation.
      
    - **Solution Idea:** Use fundamental data structures like variables, composite data structures, and arrays to organize and access data in memory.
      
- **Identify core nodes representing the main stages:**
    
    - **Problem Definition:** Need for Data Storage and Access in Programs.
      
    - **Principle 1: Named Memory Locations:** Representing individual data items.
    - **Tool 1: Variables:** Implementing named memory locations.
      
    - **Principle 2: Data Aggregation:** Grouping related data items.
    - **Tool 2: Composite Data Structures (Structs/Objects):** Implementing data aggregation.
      
    - **Principle 3: Contiguous, Indexed Storage:** Storing collections of similar items.
    - **Tool 3: Arrays:** Implementing contiguous, indexed storage.
      
    - **Principle 4: Ordered Character Sequences:** Representing textual data.
    - **Tool 4: Strings (as Arrays of Characters):** Implementing ordered character sequences.
      
    - **Application & Analysis: Using Arrays - Sorting:** How array structure impacts algorithms (Insertion Sort).
    - **Application & Analysis: Using Strings - Comparison:** How string structure impacts operations.
      
    - **Generalization/Conclusion:** Importance of these fundamental structures.
      
- **Assign preliminary KT tags (GRINDE 'N') with justification:**
    
    - **Problem Definition:** Need for Data Storage and Access ❓/ℹ️ (Identifies a core need and states facts about it).
      
    - **Principle 1: Named Memory Locations** 📖 (Explains a fundamental concept).
    - **Tool 1: Variables** ⚙️/ℹ️ (Describes the mechanism and defines it).
      
    - **Principle 2: Data Aggregation** 📖 (Explains a fundamental concept).
    - **Tool 2: Composite Data Structures** ⚙️/ℹ️ (Describes the mechanism and defines it).
      
    - **Principle 3: Contiguous, Indexed Storage** 📖 (Explains a fundamental concept).
    - **Tool 3: Arrays** ⚙️/ℹ️ (Describes the mechanism and defines it).
      
    - **Principle 4: Ordered Character Sequences** 📖 (Explains a fundamental concept for text).
    - **Tool 4: Strings (as Arrays of Characters)** ⚙️/ℹ️ (Describes the mechanism and defines it).
      
    - **Application & Analysis: Using Arrays - Sorting** ⚙️/💡 (Explains an algorithm and analyzes its characteristics/cost).
    - **Application & Analysis: Using Strings - Comparison** ⚙️/💡 (Explains an algorithm and analyzes its cost).
      
    - **Generalization/Conclusion:** Importance & Trade-offs 💡/🌐 (Discusses broader implications and connects to future learning).
