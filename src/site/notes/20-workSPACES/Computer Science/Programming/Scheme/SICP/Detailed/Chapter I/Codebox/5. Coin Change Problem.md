# 5. Coin Change Problem
## Problem
- Let $f(A,N)$ represent the number of ways of changing the amount A using N kinds of coins. 
	- If the first kind of coin has denomination N, then $f(A,N)=f(A,N−1)+f(A−D,N)$
	- In words, there are two situations: 
		- where you do not use any of the first kind of coin, and when you do. 
		- The value of $f(A,N−1)$ assumes we don’t use the first kind at all;
		- The value of $f(A−D,N)$ assumes we use one or more of the first kind.
- That rule and a few degenerate cases are sufficient to describe an algorithm for counting the number of ways of changing amounts of money. We can define it with the following piecewise function:

- Like Fibonacci, the easy tree-recursive implementation involves a lot of redundancy. 
	- Unlike it, there is no obvious iterative solution (it is possible, just harder).
- One way to improve the performance of the tree-recursive process is to use _memoization_.

## Code
```scheme
#lang racket
(require rackunit)
(require rackunit/text-ui)

;; Assume this list of coin denominations
(define coin-denominations '(1 5 10 25))

;; Assume this definition for select based on the coin-denominations list
;; It's assumed k is a positive integer corresponding to the index in the list (1-based)
(define (select k)
  (list-ref coin-denominations (- k 1)))

;; The function to be tested (as provided, with dependency on select)
(define (exchange amt k)
  (cond [(= amt 0) 1]
        [(or (< amt 0) (= k 0)) 0]
        [else (let ([without (exchange amt (- k 1))]
                    [with (exchange (- amt (select k)) k)])
                (+ without with))]))

;; Rackunit Test Suite
(define exchange-tests
  (test-suite
    "Tests for exchange function"

    ;; Test case 1: Amount 0 should have 1 way (using no coins)
    (test-case
      "exchange 0 with any number of coin types"
      (check-equal? (exchange 0 4) 1)
      (check-equal? (exchange 0 2) 1))

    ;; Test case 2: Negative amount should have 0 ways
    (test-case
      "exchange negative amount"
      (check-equal? (exchange -10 4) 0))

    ;; Test case 3: Amount with no coin types available (k=0) should have 0 ways
    (test-case
      "exchange with 0 coin types"
      (check-equal? (exchange 10 0) 0))

    ;; Test case 4: Testing with a single coin type (1 cent)
    (test-case
      "exchange with only 1-cent coins"
      (check-equal? (exchange 5 1) 1) ; 5 cents using only 1-cent coins
      (check-equal? (exchange 10 1) 1)) ; 10 cents using only 1-cent coins

    ;; Test case 5: Testing with 1-cent and 5-cent coins
    (test-case
      "exchange with 1-cent and 5-cent coins"
      (check-equal? (exchange 6 2) 2) ; 6 cents (1+5, 1+1+1+1+1+1) - assuming k=2 means using the first 2 coin types (1 and 5)
      (check-equal? (exchange 10 2) 3)) ; 10 cents (10, 5+5, 1+1..+1)

    ;; Test case 6: Testing with 1-cent, 5-cent, and 10-cent coins
    (test-case
      "exchange with 1, 5, and 10-cent coins"
      (check-equal? (exchange 10 3) 4)) ; 10 cents (10, 5+5, 5+1..+1, 1+1..+1)

    ;; Test case 7: Testing with all four coin types
    (test-case
      "exchange with 1, 5, 10, and 25-cent coins"
      (check-equal? (exchange 10 4) 4) ; Same as above, as 25 is larger than 10
      (check-equal? (exchange 25 4) 13)) ; Number of ways to make 25 cents

    ;; Add more test cases here for different amounts and k values
    ))

;; Run the tests
(run-tests exchange-tests)

## Explanation


1. **Process Type:** The `exchange` function generates a **`Tree Recursive Process` ([!TIP] ⑦ `Analysis: Processes Generated` {details} `Tree Recursive Process`)**.
    
    - In its recursive step (`else` branch), the function calls itself twice: 
	    - once for the `without` case and once for the `with` case. 
	    - This branching at each decision point creates a tree-like structure of computations, exactly as Elara described: _"Burada, bir prosedür kendini birden fazla kez çağırarak, dallanan bir süreç yapısı oluşturur. **Tıpkı bir ağacın gövdesinden çıkan ana dalların, o dallardan çıkan daha küçük dallara ayrılması gibi.**"_(Here, a procedure calls itself more than once, creating a branching process structure. **Just like the main branches coming off a tree trunk split into smaller branches.**)
	      
2. **Efficiency and Redundant Computations:** This tree recursive approach, while a direct translation of the combinatorial problem, can be inefficient due to **redundant computations**, a characteristic highlighted in **[!TIP] ⑦**.
    
    - For example, calculating the ways to make change for a specific smaller amount (e.g., `(exchange 3 1)`) might be required in multiple different branches of the overall computation tree originating from a larger problem. This is akin to Elara's warning: _"**aynı hazineyi bulmak için bir labirentin aynı koridorlarını defalarca gezen acemi bir kaşif gibi,** aynı alt problemleri tekrar tekrar hesaplayarak verimsizliğe yol açabilirler."_ (like a novice explorer repeatedly searching the same corridors of a labyrinth for the same treasure, they can lead to inefficiency by repeatedly calculating the same subproblems.) The number of such redundant calculations can grow very rapidly.
      
3. **Space Usage:** The space used by this process will be related to the maximum depth of the recursion tree. Each active call in the tree needs to store its arguments (`amt`, `k`) and the context for the pending `+` operation after its two sub-calls (`with` and `without`) return. This means deferred operations accumulate on the call stack.
