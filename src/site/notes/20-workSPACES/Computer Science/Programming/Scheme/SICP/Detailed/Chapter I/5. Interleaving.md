# 5. 5. Interleaving (I): Suggest Practice Mixing Strategies

1. **Mix Process Types:** 
	- Alternate between writing a recursive procedure (e.g., factorial ⚙️) and then immediately writing an iterative version for the same problem (⚙️). 
	- Analyze the resulting process shape (💡/🌐) and space complexity (💡) for each. (`#Recursion`, `#Iteration`, `#Complexity`)
2. **Compare Abstraction Levels:** 
	- Take a problem solved with a simple procedure (e.g., summing cubes directly). Then, solve the same problem using a higher-order procedure like `sum` (Solution 🏗️ using Tool ⚙️). 
	- Compare the clarity and generality (💡/🌐) of the two solutions. (`#Abstraction`, `#HOF`)
3. **Apply Numerical Methods:** 
	- Implement `sqrt` using the direct iterative approach (Solution 🏗️), then implement it using `fixed-point` with average damping (Solution 🏗️/💡), and finally using `newtons-method` (Solution 🏗️/💡). 
	- Compare their structure and convergence (Analysis 💡). (`#NumericalMethods`, `#FixedPoint`, `#NewtonsMethod`, `#Sqrt`)
