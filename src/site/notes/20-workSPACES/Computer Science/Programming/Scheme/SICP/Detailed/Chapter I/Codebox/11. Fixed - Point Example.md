## Explanation

- `fixed-pt` is a HOF which takes a function as an argument.

- But sometimes, this function may not converge:
	  
	- The convergence of a fixed-point iteration $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ to a fixed point $\alpha$ (where $f(\alpha) = \alpha$) depends critically on the derivative of the function $f(x)$ at that fixed point $\alpha$.

		- A sufficient condition for convergence is that $|f'(\alpha)| < 1$.
		- Here's a breakdown of the conditions:

			* If $|f'(\alpha)| < 1$:
			    * The fixed point is an **attractor**.
			    * The iteration will converge to $\alpha$ if the initial guess is sufficiently close.

			* If $|f'(\alpha)| > 1$:
			    * The fixed point is a **repeller**.
			    * The iteration will diverge from $\alpha$ (unless the initial guess is exactly $\alpha$).

			* If $|f'(\alpha)| = 1$:
			    * The test is **inconclusive**.
			    * Convergence depends on other factors (e.g., higher-order derivatives or the specific behavior of the function near $\alpha$).
			      
### Let's analyze the function $f(x) = x^2 - 9$:

#### 1. Find the Fixed Points
- We need to solve $f(x) = x$, so:
	- $x^2 - 9 = x$
- Rearranging this gives the quadratic equation:
	- $x^2 - x - 9 = 0$

- Using the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:
	- $x = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-9)}}{2(1)}$
	- $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 36}}{2}$
	- $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{37}}{2}$

- The two fixed points are:
	* $\alpha_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{37}}{2} \approx \frac{1 + 6.0828}{2} \approx 3.5414$
	* $\alpha_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{37}}{2} \approx \frac{1 - 6.0828}{2} \approx -2.5414$

#### 2. Find the Derivative
- For $f(x) = x^2 - 9$, the derivative is: $f'(x) = 2x$

#### 3. Evaluate the Derivative at the Fixed Points

* **For $\alpha_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{37}}{2}$:**
    $f'(\alpha_1) = 2 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{37}}{2} \right) = 1 + \sqrt{37} \approx 1 + 6.0828 \approx 7.0828$
    Therefore, $|f'(\alpha_1)| \approx 7.0828$

* **For $\alpha_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{37}}{2}$:**
    $f'(\alpha_2) = 2 \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{37}}{2} \right) = 1 - \sqrt{37} \approx 1 - 6.0828 \approx -5.0828$
    Therefore, $|f'(\alpha_2)| \approx 5.0828$

#### Conclusion on Convergence

- In both cases, $|f'(\alpha)| > 1$. This means that both fixed points of $f(x) = x^2 - 9$ are **repelling fixed points**. The iteration process $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ will tend to move values *away* from these points rather than towards them.

- Let's say your initial guess $x_0 = 3$ is not equal to either fixed point. The iteration starts, and because the nearby fixed point $\alpha_1 \approx 3.5414$ is repelling (since $|f'(\alpha_1)| \approx 7.0828 > 1$), the iterates are pushed away, leading to the observed divergence. The same would happen even if you started very close to either $\alpha_1$ or $\alpha_2$.

- Therefore, this particular fixed-point iteration scheme ($x_{n+1} = x_n^2 - 9$) does not converge for the function $f(x) = x^2 - 9$ because the conditions for convergence (specifically, $|f'(\alpha)| < 1$) are not met at its fixed points. The iterative process naturally diverges.


## How to make it converge

- To find the solutions of x=$x^2$−9 using the `fixed-pt` procedure, you need to provide a _different_ function, let's call it g(x), such that:

	1. The fixed points of g(x) are the same as the solutions to x=$x^2$−9 (i.e., solutions to $x^2$−x−9=0).
	    
	2. The iteration $x_{n+1}$​ = g($x_n$​) converges. This means `|g′(p)| < 1` at the fixed point p.

- To do that , we will use Newton-Raphson transformation.
