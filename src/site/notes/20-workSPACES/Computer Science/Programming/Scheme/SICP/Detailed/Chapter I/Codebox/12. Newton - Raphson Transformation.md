# 12. Newton - Raphson Transformation

## The Method

- The Newton-Raphson method is a general technique for **finding roots** of an equation $h(x)=0$. The iteration formula is:
$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{h(x_n)}{h'(x_n)}$$
- This can be seen as a fixed-point iteration for the function $g(x) = x - \frac{h(x)}{h'(x)}$. This method generally has very fast (quadratic) convergence if $h'(p) \neq 0$ at the root $p$.

- In our case, we want to solve $x^2 - x - 9 = 0$. So, let $h(x) = x^2 - x - 9$.
- The derivative is $h'(x) = 2x - 1$.
- The function to use with `fixed-pt` would be:
$$g_2(x) = x - \frac{x^2 - x - 9}{2x - 1}$$
- It can be shown that $g_2'(p) = 0$ at the roots $p$ (provided $h'(p) \neq 0$), which guarantees convergence if the initial guess is reasonably close.

- In Scheme, this would be:
```scheme
(fixed-pt (lambda (x)
            (- x
               (/ (- (* x x) x 9)
                  (- (* 2 x) 1)))))
```
- With the initial guess of $1.0$, this will also converge to the positive root $p_1 \approx 3.54138$. For example:
	- $g_2(1.0) = 1.0 - \frac{1^2 - 1.0 - 9}{2(1.0) - 1} = 1.0 - \frac{-9}{1} = 10.0$.
	- $g_2(10.0) = 10.0 - \frac{10^2 - 10 - 9}{2(10) - 1} = 10.0 - \frac{100 - 10 - 9}{19} = 10.0 - \frac{81}{19} \approx 10.0 - 4.263158 \approx 5.736842$.
- And so on, converging to $p_1$.

## Code

```scheme
#lang racket

;1. Fixed Point
; Signature Function -> Number
; Purpose Takes a function and returns its fixed point.
; Stub
#;
(define (fixed-pt f) 0)

;3. template
#;
(define (fixed-pt f)
  (... f))


; 4. Code the body
(define tolerance 0.001)
(define (fixed-pt f)
  
  (define (close-enough? p1 p2)
    (< (abs (- p1 p2)) tolerance))

  (define (iter guess)
    (let ([next (f guess)])
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          guess
          (iter next))))
  (iter 1.0))

(define (deriv f dx)
  (lambda (x) (/ (- (f (+ x dx)) (f x)) dx)))


(define (newton-transform f dx)
  (let* ([fixed-form (lambda (x) (- (f x) x))] ; x^2-9 is converted to fixed-form x^2-9 = x
        [dfixed (deriv fixed-form dx)])
    (lambda (x) (- x (/ (fixed-form x) (dfixed x))))))



;2. Examples


(require rackunit)
(require rackunit/text-ui)

(define fixed-pt-tests
  (test-suite
   "Fixed Points Of Various Functions"
   (test-case
    "trig functions"
    (check-true (< (abs (- (fixed-pt cos) 0.7395)) tolerance))
    (check-true (< (abs (- (fixed-pt sin) 0.1814)) tolerance)))

   (test-suite
    "random functions"
    (check-true (< (abs (- (fixed-pt (newton-transform (lambda (x) (- (* x x) 9)) 0.0001)) 3.5415)) tolerance))
    (check-true (< (abs (- (fixed-pt (newton-transform (lambda (x) (- (+ (* 6 x x x) (* 27 x x) (* -7 x)) 11)) 0.0001)) 0.7328)) tolerance)))

## Root Finding vs. Fixed-Point Finding: The Connection

  

- The concepts of finding a root and finding a fixed point are closely related, and you can often transform one problem into the other.

  

- **1. Root Finding Problem:**

	- You're looking for a value $x$ such that a function $f(x)$ equals zero:

$$f(x) = 0$$

  

- **2. Fixed-Point Problem:**

	- You're looking for a value $x$ such that a function $g(x)$ equals $x$ itself:

$$g(x) = x$$

### Conversion
- You can create a new function for Fixed-Point finding problem: h(x) = g(x) - x
	- find the root of the h(x) = 0  using Newton Raphson Method.
- You can create a new function for Finding root problem : j(x) = f(x) + x
	- j(x) = x , finding the fixed point of j(x)
