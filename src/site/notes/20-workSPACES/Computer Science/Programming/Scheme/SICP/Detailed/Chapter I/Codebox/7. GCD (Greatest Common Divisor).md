# 7. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

## Code
```scheme
#lang racket


(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))


(require rackunit)
(require rackunit/text-ui)

(define gcd-tests
  (test-suite
   "GCD TESTS"
   (test-case
    "Perfect Divisors"
    (check-equal? (gcd 14 7) 7)
    (check-equal? (gcd 27 9) 9))

   (test-case
    "Random"
    (check-equal? (gcd 24 14) 2)
    (check-equal? (gcd 36 24) 12))

   (test-case
    "Primes"
    (check-equal? (gcd 15 14) 1)
    (check-equal? (gcd 34 11) 1)))
  )

(run-tests gcd-tests)
```


### Runtime

More formally, the runtime complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is logarithmic with respect to the smaller of the two input numbers. If n is the smaller of `a` and `b` (i.e., n=min(a,b)), the number of recursive calls is proportional to logn.

Therefore, the order of growth for this `gcd` function is **O(log(min(a,b)))**.

**Explanation:**

- With each step of the Euclidean algorithm, `(gcd a b)` becomes `(gcd b (remainder a b))`.
- It can be shown that if a > b ≥ 0, then `(remainder a b)` is less than a/2 if b ≤ a/2, and if b>a/2, then `(remainder a b) = a - b`, which is also less than a/2.
- More tightly, in two steps, the larger number is at least halved. If we have `(gcd a b)`, then in the next step we have `(gcd b r1)` where `r1 = a (mod b)`. In the step after that, we have `(gcd r1 r2)` where `r2 = b (mod r1)`. It can be shown that r2 < b/2.
- This means that the arguments decrease in size quite rapidly (exponentially, in fact, in terms of the number of steps).
- Because the numbers decrease in this manner, the number of steps needed will be **proportional to the logarithm of the input numbers**, rather than their actual magnitude (which would be a linear runtime).
