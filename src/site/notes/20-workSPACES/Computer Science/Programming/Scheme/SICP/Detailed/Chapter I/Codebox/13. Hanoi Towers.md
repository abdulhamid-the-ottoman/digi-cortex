# 13. Hanoi Towers
## Problem

> [!QUESTION] Problem
> Assume that you have 3 pegs and a set of disks, all different diameters. 
> Start with all the disks on a single peg, in order of size (with smallest on top)
> The object of the puzzle is to move the pile of disks to a specified peg, by moving one disk at a time.
> A legal move consists of taking the top disk from any peg and putting it on either of pegs; but a disk may never be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than itself.
> Write a procedure whose output is like:
>  > 	move top disk from peg 1 to peg 3
>  >	move top disk from peg 1 to peg 2	
>  >	move top disk from peg 3 to peg 2
>  >     move top disk from peg 1 to peg 3
>  >     move top disk from peg 2 to peg 1
>  >     move top disk from peg 2 to peg 3
>  >     move top disk from peg 1 to peg 3		


## Solution

- Let's think of the problem in a recursive manner:
	- Let's assume we have 3 pegs :
		- S for source
		- D for destination
		- T for temporary
	- Let's think that we have 3 disks:
		- move 2 disks from S to T
		- move 1 disk from S to D
		- move 2 disks from T to D

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (hanoi diskid PegS PegD PegT)
  (cond [(= diskid 1) (printf "Moving disk 1 from Peg ~s to Peg ~s\n" PegS PegD)]
        [else (begin
                (hanoi (- diskid 1) PegS PegT PegD)
                (printf "Moving disk ~a from Peg ~s to Peg ~s\n" diskid PegS PegD)
                (hanoi (- diskid 1) PegT PegD PegS))]))


(hanoi 3 "S" "D" "T")
```
