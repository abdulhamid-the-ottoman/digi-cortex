# Core Study

## Chapter 1
This document introduces the core idea that **writing a program is a systematic design process**. Design is defined as the journey from a **poorly-formed problem** to a **well-structured solution**. The document outlines two main challenges in this process and their respective solutions and outcomes:

**Challenge 1: Poorly-Formed Problem Description**

- **Symptoms:** The task description might be:
    - **Vague:** Lacks clear definitions.
        - _Example:_ Not defining what a "BIG rectangle" means.
    - **Incomplete:** Doesn't address the root cause.
        - _Example:_ Focusing on a "wet surface under a valve" without identifying the underlying cause like "seal failure due to no preventative maintenance."
    - **Inconsistent:** Contains contradictory requirements.
        - _Example:_ Requiring all users to have full access to system settings while also needing to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Solutions:**
    - For vague problems: **Make a clear definition.**
    - For incomplete problems: Perform **root cause analysis** to identify the real problem.
    - For inconsistent problems: **Identify contradicting cases.**
- **Result of Addressing Challenge 1:** A **well-defined, clearer problem definition** is achieved.

**Challenge 2: Overwhelming Complexity (Problem is too big to solve at once)**

- **Symptoms:**
    - Difficulty focusing on many parts simultaneously.
    - The problem feels insurmountable.
- **Solution:**
    - Manage complexity by **breaking the problem down into well-chosen, smaller, well-defined sub-pieces.**
- **Result of Addressing Challenge 2:**
    - The ability to write large programs by first writing smaller, manageable programs and then combining them.
    - The resulting program is:
        - **Better Testable:** Smaller pieces are easier to test.
        - **Modular:** The well-chosen sub-pieces fit together well ("plug & play") and make the system more resistant to changes in one part affecting others. This also makes it easier to read and modify.
        - **Robust:** Resistant to modifications and well-tested due to the modularity and testability of its smaller components.

In essence, a systematic design process tackles initial ambiguity and complexity by first refining the problem understanding and then decomposing the problem into smaller, manageable, and testable parts, leading to robust and modular solutions.

## Chapter 2

The "How to Design Functions" (HtDF) recipe provides a systematic method for designing functions, ensuring clarity and correctness. This approach is iterative, with each step building upon the previous ones.

**The HtDF Recipe Steps:**

1. **Signature, Purpose, and Stub:**
    
    - **Signature:** Clearly defines the types of data the function will consume (inputs) and the type of data it will produce (output). For instance, a function taking an image and returning a number has the signature `Image -> Number`.   
        
    - **Purpose Statement:** A concise, one-line description of what the function aims to accomplish in terms of its inputs and outputs.   
        
    - **Stub:** A syntactically complete version of the function. It includes the correct function name and parameters but has a minimal body that returns a fixed, valid value of the function's output type (e.g., `0` for a `Number`type, `"a"` for a `String` type). The stub's primary role is to allow examples (`check-expect`s) to run early, verifying well-formedness even before the function logic is complete.   
        
        - _Example Stub for a `double` function:_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```
            ;; Number -> Number
            ;; produces n times 2
            (define (double n) 0) [cite: 19]
            ```
            
2. **Define Examples (and wrap in `check-expect`):**
    
    - Write concrete examples of how the function should behave for specific inputs, including the expected results. These examples help in understanding the function's requirements, especially for boundary conditions or different behavioral cases.   
        
    - It's often useful to show how the expected result is computed within the example.   
        
    - Wrap these examples in `check-expect` forms. This allows DrRacket to automatically run them as tests.   
        
        - _Example `check-expect`s for `double`:_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```Scheme
            (check-expect (double 0) (* 0 2)) [cite: 33]
            (check-expect (double 1) (* 1 2)) [cite: 33]
            (check-expect (double 3) (* 3 2)) [cite: 33]
            ```
            
3. **Template and Inventory:**
    
    - Before writing the function's body, outline its structure using a template. This template indicates what information (parameters, constants) is available.   
        
    - If using data definitions from the "How to Design Data Definitions" (HtDD) recipe, the template is typically copied from the data definition of the _consumed_ type and renamed.   
        
    - For functions consuming primitive data (like numbers or strings), the template body is often `(... x)`, where `x` is the parameter name.   
        
    - Once the template is established, the initial stub should be commented out. An "inventory" of relevant constants can also be added to the template.   
        
        - _Example Template for `double` (after commenting out the stub):_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```Scheme
            ;; (define (double n) 0) ; Stub commented out
            (define (double n)
              (... n))       ; Template [cite: 41]
            ```
            
4. **Code the Function Body:**
    
    - Complete the function by filling in the logic within the template. Use the signature (for type information), purpose (for what to produce), examples (for concrete behavior), and the template (for available data) as guides.   
        
        - _Example Coded Body for `double`:_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```Scheme
            (define (double n)
              (* n 2)) [cite: 44]
            ```
            
5. **Test and Debug Until Correct:**
    
    - Run the program to execute all `check-expect` tests. If any tests fail, debug the function's body until all tests pass and the function behaves as intended.   
        

**Important Principles of HtDF:**

- **Iterative Process:** While steps are generally sequential, you might revisit earlier steps if you uncover new issues or boundary conditions. For instance, discovering a missed case might require adding more examples and refining the purpose statement.   
    
- **Avoid Premature Coding:** Crucially, do not write the complete function body first and then attempt to retrofit the other HtDF elements. This discipline is vital for tackling more complex functions.   
    
- **Run Early, Run Often:** Test your code frequently, even when only the stub and examples are in place. This practice helps catch syntax errors, incorrect function calls, or misspelled names much earlier, making them easier to fix.   
    
- **Ensure Code Coverage:** If parts of your code are not executed by your tests (often highlighted by DrRacket), it means you don't have enough examples to cover all scenarios.

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Iterative Process:** HtDF is not strictly linear. Discoveries at later stages might necessitate revisiting and refining earlier steps like the purpose or examples. However, the function definition should not be written before the other elements.   
    
- **Run Early, Run Often:** Regularly run your program, even with just the stub and examples, to catch errors early.   
    
- **Specific Signatures:** Strive for the most specific data types in your signatures (e.g., `Image -> Natural` if a function operating on an image should always produce a whole number).   
    
- **Clear Purpose:** The purpose statement must clearly define the function's output, especially for functions returning booleans (e.g., specify what `true` means if a function `tall?` determines if an image is tall).   
    
- **Naming Conventions:** For functions that return a boolean value, it's a Racket convention to end the function name with a question mark (e.g., `tall?`).   
    
- **Code Coverage:** Ensure your tests execute all parts of your function's code. Uncovered code might contain hidden bugs. DrRacket can highlight unexecuted code.   
    
- **Address Corner Cases:** When you identify a boundary or special condition (a "corner case"), immediately write a test case for it. Then, update the relevant parts of your design (purpose, function definition, other tests, or even the signature).   
    
    - _Example:_ For a `tall?` image function, consider cases where width > height, height > width, and height = width.
      
## Chapter 3

It emphasizes creating clear data definitions, which in turn guide the design of functions that operate on that data.

**Core Concepts:**

- **`cond` Expression:** A conditional expression for handling more than two cases. It evaluates question-answer pairs sequentially. If a question is true, the `cond` becomes the corresponding answer. An `else` clause can catch remaining cases.
    - _Example:_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define (aspect-ratio img)
          (cond [(> (image-height img) (image-width img)) "tall"]
                [(= (image-height img) (image-width img)) "square"]
                [else "wide"]))
        ```
        
          
- **Data Definitions:** These are crucial for establishing the relationship between information in the problem domain and the data used to represent it in a program. They explain how to interpret data (e.g., the number `0`) as meaningful information (e.g., a red traffic light). A data definition typically includes:   
    
    1. **Type Comment:** Names the new data type and shows how to form its data.   
        
        - _Example:_ `;; TLColor is one of: 0 1 2`
          
    2. **Interpretation (`interp`):** Explains the meaning of the data in terms of the information it represents.   
        
        - _Example:_ `;; interp. 0 is red, 1 is yellow, and 2 is green` (modified for conciseness based on source)   
            
    3. **Examples:** Concrete instances of the data.   
        
        - _Example:_ `(define RED 0)`   
            
    4. **Template:** A skeletal structure for a one-argument function that processes data of this type. The data definition drives the template's structure.   
        
        - _Example (for TLColor):_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```Scheme
            (define (fn-for-ticolor c)
              (cond [(= c 0) (...)] ; RED case
                    [(= c 1) (...)] ; YELLOW case
                    [(= c 2) (...)])) ; GREEN case
            ```
            
              
            

**Kinds of Atomic Data Definitions and Their Templates:**

The HtDD recipe helps classify information into different kinds of atomic data, each with a corresponding template pattern:

1. **Atomic Non-Distinct Data:** Represents indivisible information that can take on many unspecified values (e.g., a city name, which is a string but could be any city).   
    
    - _Type Comment Example:_ `;; CityName is String`   
        
    - _Template Example:_ `(define (fn-for-city-name cn) (... cn))`   
        
2. **Interval:** Represents numbers within a specific range.   
    
    - _Type Comment Example:_ `;; SeatNum is Natural[1, 32]` (Natural numbers from 1 to 32, inclusive) or `;; Countdown is Integer[0, 10)` (Integers from 0 up to, but not including, 10)   
        
    - _Template Example:_ `(define (fn-for-seat-num sn) (... sn))`   
        
3. **Enumeration:** Represents a fixed, small number of distinct, known items. Often uses strings.   
    
    - _Type Comment Example:_ `;; LetterGrade is one of: "A" "B" "C"`   
        
    - _Template Example (derived from LightState example):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define (fn-for-letter-grade lg)
          (cond [(string=? lg "A") (...)]
                [(string=? lg "B") (...)]
                [(string=? lg "C") (...)]))
        ```
        
        (Template structure adapted from similar LightState example)   
        
4. **Itemization:** Describes data that can fall into one of several categories (subclasses), where at least one of these categories is not a single distinct item (e.g., it might be an interval or an atomic non-distinct type).   
    
    - _Type Comment Example:_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        ;; CountDown is one of:
        ;; - false                            (atomic distinct)
        ;; - Natural[1, 10]                   (interval)
        ;; - "complete"                       (atomic distinct)
        ```
        
          
        
    - _Template Example:_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define (fn-for-countdown c)
          (cond [(false? c) (...)]
                [(and (number? c) (>= c 1) (<= c 10)) (... c)] ; Guarded for mixed types
                [(string=? c "complete") (...)])) ; Could also be [else (...)]
        ```
        
        (Structure based on combining information from these sources)   
        
    - **Guards in Templates:** For itemizations with mixed data types (e.g., boolean, number, string), `cond` questions often need "guards" (like `(number? c)`) to prevent errors that would occur if an operation is attempted on an incorrect data type.   
        

**The Flow of Structure:**

A key takeaway is how structure propagates through the design process: The _inherent structure of the information_ in the problem domain guides the _structure of the data definition_. This data definition's structure, in turn, dictates the _structure of the function template_. Finally, the template shapes the _structure of the actual function code_ and provides guidance for creating _effective tests_.   

**Testing Considerations:**

- **Intervals:** Test boundaries (inclusive and exclusive ends) and mid-points.   
    
- **Enumerations:** Have at least one test for each distinct item in the enumeration.   
    
- **Itemizations:** Test each subclass. If a subclass is an interval, apply interval testing rules to it.

## Chapter 4
This document outlines the "How to Design Worlds" (HtDW) recipe, a structured approach for creating interactive programs and animations in Racket using the `big-bang` mechanism. The process involves analyzing the problem domain and then systematically building the program.

**Core Component: The `big-bang` Mechanism**

The `big-bang` function is central to creating interactive worlds. It takes an initial state of the world and a set of handler functions that define how the world changes and is displayed.   

- **Operation:** It repeatedly:
    1. Calls a drawing function (specified by `to-draw`) to render the current world state.   
        
    2. Calls an update function (e.g., specified by `on-tick` for time-based changes) with the current world state to produce the next world state.   
        
- **Polymorphism:** `big-bang` is versatile and can work with any data structure representing the world's state. If your world's state is represented by data type `X`, `on-tick` needs a function `X -> X`, and `to-draw` needs `X -> Image`.   
    
- **Basic Invocation:**
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    (big-bang initial-world-state
      (on-tick update-world-function)  ; For changes over time
      (to-draw render-world-function)  ; For displaying the world
      ;; Other handlers like on-key, on-mouse, stop-when can be added [cite: 13]
    )
    ```
    

**The How to Design Worlds (HtDW) Recipe**

HtDW is a two-phase recipe:

**Phase 1: Domain Analysis (Conceptual Planning)** This phase is about understanding the problem and is often done on paper.   

1. **Sketch Program Scenarios:** Visualize how the interactive program should look and behave.   
    
2. **Identify Constant Information:** Determine what elements of the program do not change (e.g., background image, window size, fixed images like the cat's appearance).   
    
    - _Example Constants:_ `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `CAT_IMG`, `MTS` (empty scene).   
        
3. **Identify Changing Information:** Pinpoint what aspects of the world evolve over time or with interaction (e.g., the cat's x-coordinate as it moves). This forms the "world state."   
    
    - _Example Changing Info:_ `cat-x` (the x-coordinate of the cat).
      
4. **Identify `big-bang` Options:** Decide which `big-bang` event handlers are needed (e.g., `on-tick` for animation, `to-draw` to show it, `on-key` for keyboard input).   
    

**Phase 2: Building the Program (Implementation)** This phase translates the analysis into code.

1. **Define Constants:** Code the constant information identified in Phase 1.b.   
    
2. **Data Definitions (HtDD for World State):** Define the data structure for the changing information (the world state) identified in Phase 1.c.   
    
    - _Example (Cat's x-coordinate):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        ;; Cat is Natural
        ;; interp. x coordinate of the cat image [cite: 2, 3]
        (define C1 0) ; Example initial cat position [cite: 3]
        (define (fn-for-cat c) (... c)) ; Data-driven template for Cat [cite: 3]
        ```
        
3. **Functions (HtDF for `main` and Handlers):**   
    
    - **`main` Function First:** Create the main function that calls `big-bang` with the initial world state and the required handler functions. Initially, the handler functions are just names (added to a "wish list").   
        
        - _Example `main` (skeleton):_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```
            (define (main initial-cat-state)
              (big-bang initial-cat-state
                (on-tick advance-cat-on-wish-list)   ; Wish list function [cite: 28]
                (to-draw render-cat-on-wish-list)))  ; Wish list function [cite: 28]
            ```
            
    - **Wish List Stubs:** Create stubs for each handler function named in `main`. These stubs have the correct signature and a minimal body, often marked to indicate they need completion.   
        
        - _Example Stubs:_
            
            Code snippet
            
            ```
            ;; advance-cat-on-wish-list : Cat -> Cat
            ;; Purpose: calculate the next position of the Cat [cite: 31]
            (define (advance-cat-on-wish-list c) c) ; Simple stub, returns current state [cite: 3] (adapted from next-cat)
            
            ;; render-cat-on-wish-list : Cat -> Image
            ;; Purpose: overlay the cat image on the background [cite: 31]
            (define (render-cat-on-wish-list c) MTS) ; Returns an empty scene [cite: 31] (MTS is a constant empty scene)
            ```
            
4. **Work Through Wish List:** Fully implement each handler function from the wish list using the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe (examples, template, body, test).   
    
    - _Example (completed `advance-cat`):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define (advance-cat c) (+ c SPEED)) ; SPEED is a movement constant [cite: 3]
        ```
        
    - _Example (completed `render-cat`):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define (render-cat c) (place-image CAT_IMG c CTR-Y MTS)) ; Places cat image at (c, CTR-Y) on empty scene [cite: 3, 5]
        ```
        

**Role of Templates in HtDW:** Templates are crucial for structuring the design process. A general `big-bang` program template helps organize constants, data definitions for the world state, the `main` function, and stubs for handler functions, breaking the overall design into manageable steps.

## Chapter 5

Compound data is essential when two or more pieces of information naturally belong together to form a single conceptual unit, such as the x and y coordinates of a point, or the first and last names of a person.

**1. Defining Structures with `define-struct`**

Racket's `define-struct` is used to create new compound data types.

- **Purpose:** To group related pieces of data into a single object.
- **Syntax:** `(define-struct <structure-name> (<field-name1> <field-name2> ...))`
    - _Example:_ To define a structure for a position with x and y coordinates:
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        (define-struct pos (x y))
        ```
        
- **Automatic Definitions:** When you use `define-struct`, Racket automatically creates several helpful functions:
    - **Constructor:** `make-<structure-name>`. This function creates instances of your structure.
        - _Example:_ `(make-pos 3 6)` creates a `pos` object where `x` is 3 and `y` is 6.   
            
    - **Selectors:** `<structure-name>-<field-name>` for each field. These functions access the values of the fields within a structure instance.
        - _Example:_ If `p1` is `(make-pos 3 6)`, then `(pos-x p1)` returns `3` and `(pos-y p1)` returns `6`.
    - **Predicate:** `<structure-name>?`. This function checks if a given value is an instance of this particular structure.
        - _Example:_ `(pos? (make-pos 3 6))` returns `true`, while `(pos? "hello")` returns `false`.

**2. Data Definitions for Compound Data (using HtDD)**

When using structures, the "How to Design Data" (HtDD) recipe is applied as follows:

1. **Structure Definition:** The `define-struct` form itself is the first part.
    - _Example:_ `(define-struct player (fn ln))`   
        
2. **Type Comment:** Describes how to create an instance of this data type using the constructor and specifies the types of the fields.
    - _Example:_ `;; Player is (make-player String String)`. This means a `Player` is created by calling `make-player` with two `String` arguments.   
        
3. **Interpretation:** Explains what an instance of the structure represents in the problem domain.
    - _Example:_ `;; Interp. (make-player fn ln) is a hockey player with first name as fn and last name as ln`.   
        
4. **Examples:** Concrete instances of the defined structure.
    - _Example:_ `(define P1 (make-player "VEHBI" "BAYRAKTAR"))`
5. **Template:** A skeleton for a function that consumes data of this compound type. The template uses the selector functions to access the fields.
    - _Example for `Player`:_
        
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (fn-for-player p)
          (... (player-fn p)  ; String
               (player-ln p))) ; String
        ```
        
    - **Reference Rule:** If a field within a structure is itself a non-primitive (user-defined) compound type, the template should include a call to that type's own template function, wrapping the selector. For example, if a `game` structure has a `ball` field which is of type `Ball` (another structure), the template for `fn-for-game` would look like `(... (fn-for-ball (game-ball g)) ...)`. If a field is a primitive type (like `Number` or `String`), no such wrapping is needed.   
        

**3. Designing Functions with Compound Data**

The "How to Design Functions" (HtDF) recipe is used:

- The template for a function consuming a single compound data instance will include all selectors for its fields.
- If a function consumes multiple compound data instances, the template includes selectors for all fields of _all_consumed parameters.
    - _Example (finding the newest of two movies):_
        
        ```
        ;; Signature: Movie Movie -> String
        ;; Purpose: to select and print the title of the newest one
        ;; Stub: (define (newest m1 m2) "")
        ;; Template:
        (define (newest m1 m2)
          (... (movie-title m1) (movie-budget m1) (movie-year m1)
               (movie-title m2) (movie-budget m2) (movie-year m2)))
        ;; Body:
        (define (newest m1 m2)
          (if (> (movie-year m1) (movie-year m2))
              (movie-title m1)
              (movie-title m2)))
        ```
        
          
        

**4. World Programs (HtDW) with Compound Data**

Compound data is often used to represent the state of a world in interactive programs (`big-bang`):

- The world state itself can be a structure, or composed of multiple interacting structures (e.g., a `Cow` structure might contain a `Position` structure and a `Direction` value).
- The "How to Design Worlds" (HtDW) recipe is followed, with the Domain Analysis identifying what parts of the world state are compound.
- Data definitions for each component of the world state (e.g., `Position`, `Direction`, `Cow`, `Perimeter`, `AnimFrame` for a cow animation ) are created using HtDD.   
    
- Event handler functions (for `on-tick`, `to-draw`, `on-key`, etc.) will consume and produce instances of these compound world state structures.

Compound data allows for better organization and management of related information, leading to clearer and more maintainable programs, especially in the context of larger applications like interactive worlds.

## Chapter 6

This document explains how to represent and process information of arbitrary size using self-referential data definitions, with a primary focus on lists in Racket. Information is considered **"arbitrary-sized"** when its extent isn't known beforehand, such as a list that could contain any number of elements.   

**1. List Construction and Access Primitives in BSL (Beginning Student Language)**

Racket provides built-in mechanisms to work with lists:

- **`empty`**: Represents an empty list. It can be an empty list of any type of value.
- **`cons`**: (short for "construct") A two-argument function that adds an element to the beginning of a list. `(cons value existing-list)` creates a new list.
    - _Example 1:_ `(define L1 (cons "Flames" empty))` creates a list containing one element: `("Flames")`.   
        
    - _Example 2:_ `(define L2 (cons "Leaves" (cons "Flames" empty)))` creates a list of two elements: `("Leaves" "Flames")`.   
        
- **`first`**: Takes a non-empty list and returns its first element.
    - _Example:_ `(first L1)` would return `"Flames"`.   
        
- **`rest`**: Takes a non-empty list and returns a new list containing all elements except the first.
    - _Example:_ `(rest L2)` would return `(cons "Flames" empty)`.
- **`empty?`**: Takes any value and returns `true` if the value is the `empty` list, and `false` otherwise.
    - _Example:_ `(empty? empty)` returns `true`.

**2. Self-Referential Data Definitions for Lists (Using HtDD)**

To define data that can be arbitrarily large, such as a list of strings, a self-referential data definition is used. This means the definition refers to itself.

- **Type Comment:** The core of the self-referential definition. It specifies the possible forms the data can take.
    - _Example for `ListOfString` (a list of strings):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```
        ;; ListOfString is one of:
        ;;  - empty                         ; Base Case: An empty list is a ListOfString
        ;;  - (cons String ListOfString)    ; Recursive Case: A String cons'd onto a ListOfString is also a ListOfString
        ```
        
- **Interpretation:** A description of what the data represents.
    - _Example:_ `;; Interp. a list of strings`
- **Examples:** Illustrative instances of the data type, including the base case and recursive cases.
    - _Example:_ `(define LOS1 empty)`, `(define LOS2 (cons "McGill" empty))`, `(define LOS3 (cons "UBC" (cons "McGill" empty)))`.
- **Template:** A skeleton for functions that operate on this data type. The template mirrors the structure of the data definition, typically using a `cond` to handle different cases. The self-referential part of the data definition leads to a "natural recursion" in the template.
    - _Example template for `ListOfString`:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (fn-for-los los)
          (cond [(empty? los) (...)]  ; What to do for the empty list (base case)
                [else (... (first los) ; How to use the first element (String)
                           (fn-for-los (rest los)))])) ; Recursive call on the rest of the list (ListOfString)
        ```
        

**3. Well-Formed Self-Referential Data Definitions**

For a self-referential data definition to be valid and useful (i.e., "well-formed"), it must satisfy two conditions:   

1. It must have at least one **base case**: a non-self-referential clause that allows recursion to terminate (e.g., `empty` for lists).   
    
2. It must have at least one **self-referential case**: a clause that refers back to the data definition itself, allowing for arbitrary size (e.g., `(cons String ListOfString)`).   
    

**4. Designing Functions for Self-Referential Data (Using HtDF)**

When designing functions that consume or produce self-referential data like lists, the "How to Design Functions" (HtDF) recipe is applied:

- **Signature, Purpose, Stub:** As per standard HtDF.
- **Examples:** Crucially, examples should cover both the base case(s) (e.g., processing an `empty` list) and the recursive/self-referential case(s) (e.g., processing non-empty lists).
- **Template:** Derived directly from the data definition's template. The recursive call in the function's template (`(fn-name (rest list-data))`) is known as **natural recursion**.
- **Code the Body:** The core logic involves defining:
    
    1. The result for the base case (when the list is `empty`).   
        
    2. How to process or use the `(first list-data)` in the recursive step.   
        
    3. How to combine the result from processing the first element with the result of the natural recursion on the `(rest list-data)`.    
        
    
    - _Example (function to check if a `ListOfString` contains "UBC"):_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (contains-ubc? los)
          (cond [(empty? los) false] ; Base case: empty list doesn't contain "UBC"
                [else (if (string=? (first los) "UBC")
                          true ; Found "UBC" at the start
                          (contains-ubc? (rest los)))])) ; Otherwise, check the rest of the list
        ```
        

- Self-referential data definitions and the concept of natural recursion are powerful tools for handling data of arbitrary and varying sizes in a structured and predictable manner.
- When the *natural recursion* comes from *a type with well-formed self reference*, you could count on the natural recursion will produce the result you expected.
	- This means, if the function is sort, and you call sort on the rest of the list, you can count on the returned list to be sorted!!! (**MAGIC**)
- For a Well-Formed Natural Recursion, there are 2 conditions to be met:
	 1. It has to come from a well-formed self-reference
	 2. Recursive definition or process must correctly refers to itself in a way that ensures it progresses towards a base case, thus avoiding infinite loops or paradoxes.

## Chapter 7

This document explains how to design data definitions and functions in Racket when the information being represented has naturally related but distinct parts. This often leads to one data definition "referring" to another, which in turn influences function design by promoting the use of helper functions.

**1. The Concept of References in Data Definitions**

References occur when you are modeling information that is structured in layers or has components that are complex entities themselves. For example, you might define a `School` and then a `ListOfSchool`. Here, `ListOfSchool` refers to the `School` data definition because each element in the list _is_ a `School`.

- **Scenario:** Representing a list of schools, where each school has a name and tuition.
    - First, define the individual `School` entity (a compound data type using `define-struct`).
    - Then, define `ListOfSchool` (a self-referential list data type) where each item in the list is of type `School`.

**2. The "Reference Rule" in Data-Driven Templates (HtDD)**

When creating a template for a data definition that refers to another user-defined data type, the "reference rule" applies:

- If a component of your data structure (e.g., the `first` element of a `ListOfSchool`) is an instance of another data definition you've made (e.g., a `School`), the template for the outer structure should include a call to the _template function_ of the referred-to structure.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - **School Data Definition & Template:**
        
        ```Scheme
        (define-struct school (name tuition))
        ;; School is (make-school String Natural)
        ;; interp. (make-school n t) is a school with name n and tuition t.
        (define (fn-for-school s)
          (... (school-name s)        ; Accessor for name
               (school-tuition s)))   ; Accessor for tuition
        ```
        
    - **ListOfSchool Data Definition & Template (Illustrating Reference):**
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; ListOfSchool is one of:
        ;;  - empty
        ;;  - (cons School ListOfSchool)
        ;; interp. ListOfSchools is a list containing school information.
        (define (fn-for-los los)
          (cond [(empty? los) (...)]  ; Base case for the list
                [else
                 (... (fn-for-school (first los))  ; REFERENCE RULE: (first los) is a School, so call fn-for-school
                      (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))    ; Self-reference: (rest los) is ListOfSchool
        ```
        
    
    In the `fn-for-los` template, `(fn-for-school (first los))` is considered a "natural helper" component.
    

**3. Helper Functions in Function Design (HtDF)**

When you design a function that processes data involving references (like the `ListOfSchool` example), the template often naturally suggests breaking the problem down using helper functions.

- The part of the template that refers to another data definition's template (e.g., `(fn-for-school (first los))`) indicates where a helper function will be used. This helper function will be responsible for processing the specific referenced component (e.g., a single `School`).
    
- The main function will then orchestrate calls to this helper function and combine its results, often with the results of natural recursion.
    
- **Example: Designing a `chart` function for `ListOfSchool`** The goal is to produce a bar chart image from a list of schools.
    
    1. **Main Function (`chart`):**
        
        - **Signature:** `ListOfSchool -> Image`
        - **Purpose:** Takes a list of schools and produces a bar chart image.
        - **Template (derived from `fn-for-los`):**
            
            ```Scheme
            (define (chart los)
              (cond [(empty? los) (square 0 "solid" "white")] ; Base case: empty image for empty list
                    [else
                     (beside/align "bottom"
                                   (make-bar (first los))      ; Call to helper function for the first school
                                   (chart (rest los)))]))     ; Recursive call for the rest of the schools
            ```
            
        - Here, `(make-bar (first los))` replaces the generic `(fn-for-school (first los))`. `make-bar` is a new function (added to a "wish list") that will process a single `School`.
    2. **Helper Function (`make-bar`):**
        
        - **Signature:** `School -> Image`
        - **Purpose:** Produces the visual bar for a single school.
        - **Template (derived from `fn-for-school`):**
            
            ```Scheme
            (define (make-bar s)
              (... (school-name s)
                   (school-tuition s)))
            ```
            
        - **Coded Body (simplified):**
            
            ```Scheme
            (define (make-bar s)
              (overlay/align "center" "bottom"
                             (rotate 90 (text (school-name s) FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR)) ; FONT_SIZE, etc. are constants
                             (rectangle BAR-WIDTH (* (school-tuition s) Y-SCALE)) "solid" BAR-COLOR)))
            ```
            

In essence, data definition references guide the decomposition of complex problems into manageable parts, naturally leading to the use of helper functions that operate on these specific parts. The templates derived from data definitions make this decomposition explicit.

## Chapter 8

This document explores the concept of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) as a form of arbitrary-sized information, similar to lists. It demonstrates how they can be defined and operated upon using self-referential data definitions and recursive functions in Racket.

**1. Natural Numbers and List Analogies**

Natural numbers can grow indefinitely, and their construction and deconstruction have parallels with list operations:

- **`add1`**: A function that takes a natural number and produces the next larger natural number (e.g., `(add1 0)` is `1`). This is analogous to `cons` for lists, as it "builds up" the number.   
    
- **`sub1`**: A function that takes a natural number greater than 0 and produces the next smaller natural number (e.g., `(sub1 2)` is `1`). This is analogous to `rest` for lists, as it "breaks down" the number.   
    

**2. Data Definition for Built-in Natural Numbers (HtDD)**

A self-referential data definition can describe natural numbers:

- **Type Comment:**
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; Natural is one of:
    ;;   - 0                ; Base case
    ;;   - (add1 Natural)   ; Self-referential case: a natural is 1 + another natural
    ```
    
- **Interpretation:** Represents a standard natural number.   
    
- **Examples:** `(define N0 0)`, `(define N1 (add1 N0)) ; N1 is 1`.   
    
- **Template (`fn-for-natural`):** Functions operating on naturals often use `zero?` to check for the base case (0) and `sub1` for the recursive step (natural recursion).
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (fn-for-natural n)
      (cond [(zero? n) (...)]                         ; Result for base case 0
            [else (... n                              ; How to use/process n
                       (fn-for-natural (sub1 n)))])) ; Recursive call on n-1
    ```
    

**3. Designing Functions on Natural Numbers (HtDF)**

The "How to Design Functions" (HtDF) recipe applies directly:

- _Example (Summing naturals from 0 to `n`):_
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; Signature: Natural -> Natural
    ;; Purpose: Produces the sum of all natural numbers from 0 up to n.
    (define (sum n)
      (cond [(zero? n) 0]          ; Base case: sum of 0 is 0
            [else (+ n (sum (sub1 n)))])) ; Recursive step: n + sum of (n-1)
    ```
    
- _Example (Creating a list of numbers from `n` down to 1):_

    ```Scheme
    ;; Signature: Natural -> ListOfNatural
    ;; Purpose: Produces a list containing numbers from n down to 1.
    (define (nlist n)
      (cond [(zero? n) empty]      ; Base case: empty list for 0
            [else (cons n (nlist (sub1 n)))])) ; Recursive step: cons n with list from (n-1)
    ```

**4. A "Parlor Trick": Defining Naturals and Arithmetic from Scratch**

The document demonstrates an interesting exercise: if Racket lacked built-in numbers, one could define them using list-like principles. This involves creating a custom representation for natural numbers (`NATURAL`) and then defining arithmetic operations on this custom type.

- **Custom `NATURAL` Data Definition:**

    ```Scheme
    ;; NATURAL is one of:
    ;;   - empty              ; Represents 0 (base case)
    ;;   - (cons "!" NATURAL) ; Represents (n+1), where NATURAL is n (self-referential case)
    ```
    
    The interpretation is that the number of `"!"` symbols in the list represents the natural number.   
    
- **Custom Primitives for `NATURAL`:**
    - `ZERO?`: Checks if a `NATURAL` is `empty`. `(define (ZERO? n) (empty? n))`   
        
    - `ADD1`: Prepends `"!"` to a `NATURAL`. `(define (ADD1 n) (cons "!" n))`   
        
    - `SUB1`: Removes the first `"!"` from a `NATURAL`. `(define (SUB1 n) (rest n))`   
        
- **Designing Arithmetic Functions for `NATURAL` (Examples):**
    - **`ADD` Function:**
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; Signature: NATURAL NATURAL -> NATURAL
        ;; Purpose: Adds two NATURAL numbers.
        (define (ADD a b)
          (cond [(ZERO? a) b]                        ; If a is 0, result is b
                [else (ADD (SUB1 a) (ADD1 b))]))    ; Else, decrement a, increment b, and recurse
        ```
        
          
        
    - **`SUBTRACT` Function:**
        
        ```
        ;; Signature: NATURAL NATURAL -> NATURAL
        ;; Purpose: Subtracts NATURAL b from NATURAL a (if a < b, returns 0).
        (define (SUBTRACT a b)
          (cond [(ZERO? b) a]                        ; If b is 0, result is a
                [(ZERO? a) NO]                       ; If a is 0 (and b isn't), result is 0 (NO is 'empty) [cite: 28]
                [else (SUBTRACT (SUB1 a) (SUB1 b))])) ; Else, decrement both and recurse
        ```
        
        Functions like `TIMES` (multiplication) and `FACT` (factorial) can also be built using this custom `NATURAL`system, typically relying on `ADD` and further recursive definitions.   
        
## Chapter 9

This document discusses the use of "helper functions" in Racket program design. Helper functions are smaller, focused functions that assist a main function in completing its task. They are particularly useful for breaking down complex problems into more manageable parts. The document highlights several key scenarios where helper functions are beneficial:

**1. References to Other Non-Primitive Data Definitions (Natural Helpers)**

- **Context:** This arises from the "Reference Rule" in How to Design Data (HtDD). When a data definition (e.g., `ListOfSchool`) contains elements of another user-defined complex type (e.g., `School`), the template for processing the outer type ( `ListOfSchool`) will naturally include a call to the template of the inner type ( `School`).
- **Helper Emergence:** In the actual function, this "template call" for the inner type often becomes a call to a specific helper function designed to process instances of that inner type.
    - _Example:_ A function processing `ListOfSchool` might call a helper to process each individual `School`element.

**2. Function Composition**

- **Context:** Used when a main function needs to perform two or more distinct, sequential operations on its input data. The output of one operation becomes the input for the next.
  
- **Helper Emergence:** Instead of a complex, monolithic function, the main function's body becomes a composition of calls to helper functions, each performing one distinct operation. The standard data-driven template for the main function might be set aside in favor of this compositional structure.
    - _Example:_ A function `arrange-images` that sorts a list of images by size and then lays them out side-by-side. 
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; Main function using composition
        (define (arrange-images loi)
          (layout-images (sort-images loi))) ; sort-images and layout-images are helpers [cite: 29]
        
        ;; Helper 1: sort-images (ListOfImage -> ListOfImage)
        ;; Purpose: returns an ordered List of Images by size. [cite: 34]
        (define (sort-images loi) loi) ; Stub, actual implementation is recursive [cite: 35]
        
        ;; Helper 2: layout-images (ListOfImage -> Image)
        ;; Purpose: places images beside each other in list order. [cite: 34]
        (define (layout-images loi) BLANK) ; Stub, actual implementation is recursive [cite: 34]
        ```
        

**3. Handling a Knowledge Domain Shift**

- **Context:** When a function, in the course of its main task, encounters a sub-problem that requires a different kind of knowledge or logic (a "shift" in the problem domain).
- **Helper Emergence:** A helper function is created to encapsulate the logic for this different knowledge domain, keeping the main function focused on its primary responsibility.
    - _Example:_ An `insert` function (which inserts an image into a sorted list of images based on area) needs to compare the areas of two images. Comparing image areas is a different "knowledge domain" than managing a sorted list. 
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; insert function (simplified)
        (define (insert image loi)
          (cond [(empty? loi) (cons image loi)]
                [else (if (larger? image (first loi)) ; Calls 'larger?' helper [cite: 73]
                          (cons image loi)
                          (cons (first loi) (insert image (rest loi))))]))
        
        ;; Helper: larger? (Image Image -> Boolean)
        ;; Purpose: returns true if the first image's area is larger. [cite: 78]
        (define (larger? i1 i2)
          (> (* (image-width i1) (image-height i1))
             (* (image-width i2) (image-height i2))))
        ```
        
          
**4. Operating on Arbitrary-Sized Data (Specifically, the "Whole List" Problem)**

- **Context:** In recursive functions that process lists (like the standard template for `ListOfImage`), each step typically works with the `(first loi)` and the result of a recursive call on `(rest loi)`. Sometimes, to process `(first loi)`correctly, you need to operate on the _entirety_ of `(rest loi)` (or the list generated by its recursive processing), not just a single value derived from it.
  
- **Helper Emergence:** A helper function is needed to perform this operation on the (potentially arbitrary-sized) sub-list. This is common in sorting algorithms.
    - _Example:_ The `sort-images` function uses an `insert` helper. To place `(first loi)` into its correct position, `insert` must traverse the already sorted `(rest loi)` (which is itself an arbitrary-sized list). 
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; sort-images function
        (define (sort-images loi)
          (cond [(empty? loi) empty]
                [else (insert (first loi)             ; 'insert' is the helper
                              (sort-images (rest loi)))])) ; '(sort-images (rest loi))' is the sorted rest of the list
        ```
        
    - The `insert` function (defined above) is the helper that operates on the arbitrary-sized sorted list produced by the natural recursion.   
        

- In summary, helper functions are a key strategy for managing complexity in program design, allowing for clearer, more modular, and maintainable code by breaking tasks into specialized pieces.

## Chapter 10
This document introduces Binary Search Trees (BSTs) as a data structure designed for efficient searching, often outperforming simple list lookups. It covers their definition, the invariant that governs them, and how to design functions to operate on them.

**1. List Abbreviations and Searching Limitations**

- **List Abbreviations:** Racket's Beginning Student language with List Abbreviations allows for `(list element1 element2 ...)` as a more convenient way to write lists than nested `cons` calls. `cons` is still used to add a single element to the front of an existing list, while `append` merges two lists.
- **List Search Inefficiency:** Searching for an item in an unsorted list takes linear time, proportional to the number of items (O(n)). Even a sorted list, if traversed linearly, still results in O(n) search time for an arbitrary element.

**2. Binary Search Trees (BSTs): Concept and Invariant**

BSTs offer a way to organize data (like user accounts, often with a key like an account number and an associated value like a name) to achieve faster search times, typically O(logn) in balanced trees.

- **Structure Idea:** A BST is a tree where each node contains:
    - A **key** (e.g., account number) used for ordering.
    - A **value** (e.g., account name) associated with the key.
    - A **left child**, which is itself a BST containing nodes with keys smaller than the current node's key.
    - A **right child**, which is itself a BST containing nodes with keys larger than the current node's key.
      
- **BST Invariant:** This rule is fundamental and must hold true for the entire tree:
    1. For any given node, all keys in its **left** subtree must be **less than** the node's key.
    2. For any given node, all keys in its **right** subtree must be **greater than** the node's key.
    3. (Often, it's also an invariant that the same key does not appear twice in the tree).

**3. Data Definition for BSTs (Using HtDD)**

A BST is a self-referential data structure.

1. **Structure Definition (for a node):**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define-struct node (key value l r)) ; 'l' for left subtree, 'r' for right subtree
    ```
    
2. **Type Comment:**
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; BST is one of:
    ;;  - false                                    ; Base Case: Represents an empty tree or no child.
    ;;  - (make-node Integer String BST BST)       ; Self-Referential Case: A node with a key (Integer),
    ;;                                             ; a value (String), a left BST, and a right BST.
    ```
    
3. **Interpretation:**
    - `false` means no BST or an empty BST.
    - `(make-node k v l r)` is a BST where `k` is the key, `v` is the value, `l` is the left subtree, and `r` is the right subtree.
    - **Crucially, the BST INVARIANT must be stated here.**
      
      
4. **Examples:**
    - Empty BST: `(define BST0 false)`
    - Single node BST: `(define BST1 (make-node 1 "abc" false false))`
    - More complex BST (respecting the invariant):
        
        ```Scheme
        (define BST4 (make-node 4 "dcj" false (make-node 7 "ruf" false false)))
        (define BST3 (make-node 3 "ilk" BST1 BST4)) ; BST1 is left child, BST4 is right
        ```
        
5. **Template (`fn-for-BST`):** The template for functions operating on BSTs mirrors its recursive definition.
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (fn-for-BST bst)
      (cond [(false? bst) (...)]  ; Case for an empty tree
            [else (... (node-key bst)
                       (node-val bst)
                       (fn-for-BST (node-l bst))   ; Recursive call for left subtree
                       (fn-for-BST (node-r bst)))])) ; Recursive call for right subtree
    ```
    

**4. Designing Functions on BSTs (Using HtDF)**

- **`lookup-key` Function (Searching in a BST):**
    - **Signature:** `BST Natural -> String or false` (returns the value if the key is found, `false` otherwise).
    - **Purpose:** To find a node with a given key in the BST. If found, produce its value; otherwise, produce `false`.
    - **Logic (exploiting the BST invariant):**
        1. If the current BST is `false` (empty), the key isn't found, so return `false`.
        2. Compare the target key `k` with the current node's key `(node-key bst)`:
            - If `k` equals `(node-key bst)`, the key is found; return `(node-val bst)`.
            - If `k` is less than `(node-key bst)`, recursively search in the left subtree: `(lookup-key (node-l bst) k)`.
            - If `k` is greater than `(node-key bst)`, recursively search in the right subtree: `(lookup-key (node-r bst) k)`.
    - _Example Body:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (lookup-key bst k)
          (cond [(false? bst) false]
                [else (cond [(= k (node-key bst)) (node-val bst)]
                            [(< k (node-key bst)) (lookup-key (node-l bst) k)]
                            [(> k (node-key bst)) (lookup-key (node-r bst) k)])]))
        ```
        
- **`render` Function (Visualizing a BST):**
    - **Signature:** `BST -> Image`
    - **Purpose:** To generate an image representation of the BST.
    - **Logic (for one level, with recursive calls for subtrees):**
        1. If the BST is `false`, return a predefined empty image (e.g., `NOBST`).
        2. Otherwise, create an image of the current node's key and value (e.g., as text).
        3. Recursively call `render` on the left subtree and the right subtree.
        4. Combine these three images: the current node's image placed `above` the `beside` combination of the left and right subtree images (with appropriate spacing constants like `VSPACE` and `HSPACE`).
    - _Example Body (conceptual):_
        
        Code snippet
        
        ```Scheme
        (define NOBST (square 10 "solid" "white")) ; Example for an empty tree's image
        (define (render bst)
          (cond [(false? bst) NOBST]
                [else (above (text (string-append (number->string (node-key bst)) ":" (node-val bst)) FONT-SIZE FONT-COLOR) ; Constants
                             VSPACE
                             (beside (render (node-l bst))
                                     HSPACE
                                     (render (node-r bst))))]))
        ```
        

- BSTs provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data by leveraging their ordered, recursive structure, making them a cornerstone in computer science for search operations.


## Chapter 11

- This document explains "mutual reference" in data definitions, a concept used to model complex, arbitrarily-sized data structures like "arbitrary arity trees." 
- These are trees where nodes can have any number of children, and the tree can be both arbitrarily wide and arbitrarily deep, much like a file system directory structure.

**1. Arbitrary Arity Trees and Mutually Recursive Data**

- **Structure:** Unlike binary trees (which have at most two children per node), arbitrary arity trees allow a node (e.g., a directory) to contain a list of many sub-elements (files or other directories). This creates variability in two dimensions:
    - **Arbitrary Width:** A node can have an arbitrary number of children, often represented as a list.
    - **Arbitrary Depth:** The tree can extend downwards to any level.
      
- **Mutual Reference:** To define such structures, two (or more) data definitions are often used that refer to each other. For instance, an `Element` (representing a file or directory) might contain a `ListOfElement` (its children), and `ListOfElement`, in turn, is a list composed of `Element`s. This circular reference between distinct data definitions is called mutual reference.

**2. Data Definitions for Arbitrary Arity Trees (Using HtDD)**

A common example is representing a file system element:

1. **Structure Definition (for an `Element` - a file or directory node):**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define-struct elt (name data subs))
    ;; name: String (name of the file/directory)
    ;; data: Integer (e.g., size of a file; 0 for a directory to indicate it uses 'subs')
    ;; subs: ListOfElement (list of sub-elements, i.e., children)
    ```
    
2. **Type Comments (Illustrating Mutual and Self Reference):**
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; Element is (make-elt String Integer ListOfElement)
    ;; interp. An element in the file system. If 'data' is 0, 'subs' is considered the list of sub-elements.
    ;;         If 'data' is not 0 (it's a file), 'subs' is ignored.
    ;;         This definition MUTUALLY REFERS to ListOfElement for its 'subs' field.
    
    ;; ListOfElement is one of:
    ;;  - empty
    ;;  - (cons Element ListOfElement)
    ;; interp. A list of file system Elements.
    ;;         This definition SELF-REFERS for the 'rest' of the list,
    ;;         and MUTUALLY REFERS to Element for the 'first' item in the cons cell.
    ```
    
    - The **self-reference** in `ListOfElement` allows a directory to contain an arbitrary number of children (arbitrary width).
    - The **mutual reference** cycle (Element -> ListOfElement -> Element) allows the tree structure to extend to an arbitrary depth.
      
3. **Templates (Resulting in Mutual Recursion):** Templates for mutually referential data definitions will also be mutually recursive. The template for processing an `Element` will naturally call the template for `ListOfElement` to handle its children, and vice-versa.
    
    - _Template for `ListOfElement`:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (fn-for-loe loe)
          (cond [(empty? loe) (...)]  ; Base case for the list
                [else (... (fn-for-element (first loe))  ; Mutual recursive call for the Element
                           (fn-for-loe (rest loe)))]))     ; Self-recursive call for the rest of the list
        ```
        
    - _Template for `Element`:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (fn-for-element elt)
          (... (elt-name elt)
               (elt-data elt)
               (fn-for-loe (elt-subs elt))))            ; Mutual recursive call for the list of children
        ```
        

**3. Designing Functions for Mutually Recursive Data (Using HtDF)**

When a task involves processing one of these mutually defined types (e.g., an `Element`), you typically design a set of mutually recursive functions—one for each data definition involved in the mutual reference.

- _Example: Summing data in all file elements in a tree:_ You'd design two functions:
    
    1. `sum-data-element` (consumes `Element`, produces `Integer`)
    2. `sum-data-loe` (consumes `ListOfElement`, produces `Integer`)
    
    - _Bodies (illustrating mutual recursion):_
        
        ```scheme
        (define (sum-data-loe loe)
          (cond [(empty? loe) 0]
                [else (+ (sum-data-element (first loe))
                         (sum-data-loe (rest loe)))]))
        
        (define (sum-data-element elt)
          (+ (elt-data elt) ; data of the current element (0 for directories)
             (sum-data-loe (elt-subs elt)))) ; sum of data from its children
        ```
        
- _Example: Collecting all names in the tree:_
    
    1. `to-list-element` (consumes `Element`, produces `ListOfString`)
    2. `to-list-loe` (consumes `ListOfElement`, produces `ListOfString`)
    
    - _Bodies:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (to-list-loe loe)
          (cond [(empty? loe) empty]
                [else (append (to-list-element (first loe))
                ; append results from processing each element
                              (to-list-loe (rest loe)))])) 
        
        (define (to-list-element elt)
          (cons (elt-name elt) ; current element's name
                (to-list-loe (elt-subs elt)))) ; list of names from children
        ```
        

**4. Backtracking Search in Arbitrary Arity Trees**

- **Concept:** A search algorithm that explores a tree branch by branch. If a search down one branch (subtree) fails to find the target, the algorithm "backtracks" (returns) to the parent node and tries the next available branch.
  
- **Application:** Useful for finding an element by a specific property (e.g., name) in an arbitrary arity tree.
  
- **Function Structure:** Typically involves mutually recursive functions (e.g., `find-element` and `find-loe`) where the list-processing function iterates through children, calling the element-processing function on each. If a child search is successful, the result is propagated up; otherwise, the search continues with the next child or backtracks.
    - _Simplified `find-element` (searches for a name, returns data or `false`):_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (find-element name elt)
          (if (string=? name (elt-name elt))
              (elt-data elt)                        ; Found at the current node
              (find-loe name (elt-subs elt))))      ; Else, search in its children
        
        (define (find-loe name loe)
          (cond [(empty? loe) false]                ; Not found in this list branch
                [else (let ([found-in-first (find-element name (first loe))])
                        (if (false? found-in-first) ; If not in first child's subtree
                            (find-loe name (rest loe)) ; Backtrack: try next child in the list
                            found-in-first))]))       ; Else, found it
        ```
        

- Mutual reference allows for the elegant definition and processing of complex, deeply nested, and variably wide data structures, with function designs naturally mirroring the data's recursive and mutually recursive nature.

## Chapter 12
This document explains a systematic approach for designing functions in Racket that consume two arguments, where both arguments are of a "one-of" type. A "one-of" type is a data type that can take one of several distinct forms (e.g., a list is either `empty` or it's a `cons` cell). The core tool introduced is the **Cross Product of Type Comments Table**, which helps in analyzing the possible combinations of these types and structuring the function design.

**1. The Challenge: Functions with Multiple "One-of" Type Arguments**

When a function takes multiple arguments, and each can independently be one of several cases, the number of combined scenarios can grow. For instance, if a function takes two lists (`lsta` and `lstb`), and each list can either be `empty` or non-empty (`cons ...`), there are four primary structural combinations to consider for the input.

**2. The Cross Product of Type Comments Table**

This table is a modeling tool to systematically consider all combinations of cases for the input arguments.
- **Creation:**
    - The axes of the table represent the different cases for each "one-of" type argument.
    - Each cell in the table corresponds to a unique pairing of these cases.
- **Example:** For a function `(prefix=? lsta lstb)` where both `lsta` and `lstb` are `ListOfString` (which is either `empty` or `(cons String ListOfString)`):
    
| `lstb` \ `lsta` | `empty`                                 | **(non-empty)**                             |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **`empty`**     | `lsta` is empty<br>`lstb` is empty      | `lsta` is non-empty,<br>`lstb` is empty     |
| **(non-empty)** | `lsta` is empty,<br>`lstb` is non-empty | `lsta` is non-empty,<br>`lstb` is non-empty |

    
- **Purpose:**
    1. **Systematic Example Generation:** The table guides the creation of test cases (`check-expect`s) by ensuring that each distinct input scenario (each cell) is considered.
    2. **Template Derivation:** It helps in structuring the function's conditional logic (`cond` expression), as each cell might require different handling.
    3. **Simplification:** By analyzing the expected outcomes for each cell (often determined during example generation), the function's conditional structure can often be simplified if multiple cells lead to the same result or follow similar logic.

**3. Applying HtDF with the Cross Product Table (Example: `prefix?` function)**

- Let's design `(prefix=? lsta lstb)`, which checks if `lsta` is a prefix of `lstb`.

1. **Data Definition (for `ListOfString`):**
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; ListOfString is one of:
    ;;   - empty
    ;;   - (cons String ListOfString)
    ;; interp. represents a list of strings
    (define (fn-for-los los) ; Standard template for ListOfString
      (cond [(empty? los) (...)]
            [else (... (first los) (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))
    ```
    
2. **Signature, Purpose, Stub (for `prefix?`):**
    
    - **Signature:** `ListOfString ListOfString -> Boolean`
    - **Purpose:** Produce `true` if `lsta` is a prefix of `lstb`, `false` otherwise.
    - **Stub:** `(define (prefix=? lsta lstb) false)`
      
3. **Cross Product Table & Examples:**
    
    - Cell 1: `lsta` is `empty`, `lstb` is `empty`. Expected: `true`. `(check-expect (prefix=? empty empty) true)`
    - Cell 2: `lsta` is non-empty, `lstb` is `empty`. Expected: `false`. `(check-expect (prefix=? (list "x") empty) false)`
      
    - Cell 3: `lsta` is `empty`, `lstb` is non-empty. Expected: `true` (empty list is a prefix of any list). `(check-expect (prefix=? empty (list "x")) true)`
      
    - Cell 4: `lsta` is non-empty, `lstb` is non-empty.
        - If `(first lsta)` matches `(first lstb)`, then recurse on `(rest lsta)` and `(rest lstb)`. `(check-expect (prefix=? (list "a" "b") (list "a" "b" "c")) true)`
        - If `(first lsta)` does not match `(first lstb)`, then `false`. `(check-expect (prefix=? (list "a") (list "b")) false)`
        - If `lsta` is longer after matching parts, then `false` (implicitly handled by `lstb` becoming empty first in recursion if `lsta` was longer and matched up to `lstb`'s length).
          
       
| `lstb` \ `lsta` | `empty` | **(non-empty)** |
| :-------------- | :------ | :-------------- |
| **`empty`**     | *true*  | *false*         |
| **(non-empty)** | *true*  | calculate       |
       
          
4. **Template and Simplification:**
    - An initial template might have four `cond` clauses, one for each cell.
    - Observing the example outcomes allows simplification:
        - If `lsta` is `empty` (covers cells 1 and 3 in a simplified view), the result is `true`.
        - Else (if `lsta` is not `empty`), if `lstb` is `empty` (covers cell 2), the result is `false`.
        - Else (both `lsta` and `lstb` are not `empty`), compare their first elements and recurse if they match.
5. **Code the Body (Optimized based on analysis):**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (prefix=? lsta lstb)
      (cond
        [(empty? lsta) true] ; An empty list is a prefix of any list (including empty)
        [(empty? lstb) false] ; A non-empty list cannot be a prefix of an empty list
        [else (if (string=? (first lsta) (first lstb))
                  (prefix=? (rest lsta) (rest lstb)) ; Recurse if first elements match
                  false)])) ; If first elements don't match, it's not a prefix
    ```
    
    (This refined logic directly implements the definition of a prefix.)
    
6. **Test and Debug:** Ensure all generated examples pass.
    

**Key Takeaway:** The Cross Product of Type Comments Table provides a structured way to manage the complexity of designing functions that operate on multiple arguments with "one-of" types. It acts as a model to guide example generation and template design, often leading to more robust and simplified functions.


## Chapter 13
This document explains the `local` expression in Racket, a powerful construct for managing definitions and improving program structure and performance. `local` allows you to define constants, functions, and even structures that are only visible and usable within a specific section of your code, known as its "body."

**1. Forming and Understanding `local`**

A `local` expression consists of two main parts:

- **Local Definitions:** A section enclosed in square brackets `[...]` where you can place one or more `define`statements (for constants or functions) or `define-struct` statements.
    
- **Body:** A single expression that follows the local definitions. The local definitions are in scope only within this body.
    
- **Syntax:**
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    (local [ <definition1>
             <definition2>
             ... ]
      <body-expression>)
    ```
    
- **Example:**
    
    Code snippet
    
    ```
    (local [(define p "accio")
            (define (fetch n) (string-append p n))]  ; 'p' and 'fetch' are local
      (fetch "portkey")) ; Body: This will produce "accio portkey"
    ```
    
    The definitions of `p` and `Workspace` are not visible outside this `local` block.
    

**2. Lexical Scoping with `local`**

`local` introduces new "scope contours" (think of them as nested boxes):

- Definitions made inside a `local` are recorded within that `local`'s scope.
- If a local definition shares a name with a definition in an outer scope (e.g., a global definition), the local definition "shadows" the outer one _within the `local`'s body_.
- When Racket looks up a name, it starts from the innermost scope and works outwards until a definition is found.

**3. Evaluation of `local` Expressions**

When a `local` expression is evaluated, Racket performs a three-step process (conceptually in one go):

1. **Renaming:** All definitions within the `local` block, and all references to them _within that `local` block's scope_, are given new, globally unique names. This prevents name collisions.
2. **Lifting:** These renamed definitions are effectively "lifted" out of the `local` to the top level of the program, as if they were temporary global definitions.
3. **Replacement:** The entire `local` expression is then replaced by its (renamed) body, which can now use the lifted definitions.

The `local` expression itself evaluates to the value of its body.

**4. Key Uses of `local`**

`local` serves two primary important purposes:

- **Encapsulation (Hiding Helper Functions):**
    
    - **Purpose:** To organize code by hiding internal helper functions and exposing only a single, primary function to the rest of the program. This is particularly useful for complex operations involving multiple, often mutually recursive, helper functions (like those seen in processing complex data structures like arbitrary arity trees).
    - **Method:** The main function that the outside world will call is defined. Inside this function, a `local`expression is used. The helper functions are defined within the `local`'s definition section. The body of the `local` then typically makes an initial call (a "trampoline" call) to one of these local helper functions to start the computation.
    - **Benefits:** Reduces the number of functions in the global namespace, simplifies the program's public interface, and can make testing the public interface more straightforward.
    - _Example (Conceptual: `sum-data` with local helpers):_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (sum-data main-element)
          (local [;; Local helper for individual elements
                  (define (sum-element e)
                    ;; ... logic to sum data in e, possibly calling sum-list-of-elements ...
                    )
                  ;; Local helper for lists of elements
                  (define (sum-list-of-elements loe)
                    ;; ... logic to sum data in loe, possibly calling sum-element ...
                    )]
            (sum-element main-element))) ; Trampoline call
        ```
        
- **Avoiding Redundant Computation (Performance Optimization):**
    
    - **Purpose:** To prevent the same (potentially expensive) computation from being performed multiple times within a function, which can sometimes lead to severe performance issues like exponential time complexity, especially in recursive functions.
    - **Method:** If an expression's value is needed in several places within a block of code (e.g., in an `if` condition and also in one of its branches), wrap that block in a `local`. In the `local`'s definitions section, compute the expression once and `define` a local name for its result. Then, use this local name wherever the result is needed in the body.
    - **Benefits:** Can dramatically improve performance by ensuring expensive computations are done only once.
    - _Example (Optimizing a recursive `find-in-list-of-elements` helper):_ Original problematic code where `(find-in-element name (first loe))` might be called twice:
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; (define (find-in-list-of-elements name loe)
        ;;   (cond [(empty? loe) false]
        ;;         [else (if (false? (find-in-element name (first loe))) ; Call 1
        ;;                       (find-in-list-of-elements name (rest loe))
        ;;                       (find-in-element name (first loe)))]))   ; Call 2
        ```
        
        Improved version using `local`:
        ```Scheme
        (define (find-in-list-of-elements name loe)
          (cond [(empty? loe) false]
                [else (local [(define found-in-first (find-in-element name (first loe)))] ; Computed once
                        (if (false? found-in-first)
                            (find-in-list-of-elements name (rest loe))
                            found-in-first))])) ; Re-used here
        ```
        

By providing mechanisms for lexical scoping, encapsulation, and memoizing computations, `local` is a vital tool for writing clear, organized, and efficient Racket programs.

## Chapter 14
- This document explores the concept of **abstraction** in programming, specifically within Racket. 
- Abstraction is a powerful technique for reducing code repetition by identifying common patterns in functions or expressions and creating more general, reusable versions. These general versions are often called "abstract functions."

**1. Creating Abstract Functions from Examples**

One way to achieve abstraction is by "working backwards" from existing, similar pieces of code:

1. **Identify Repetitive Code:** Find two or more functions or expressions that perform similar tasks but differ in small, identifiable "points of variance."
    - _Example:_ Two functions, `contains-ubc?` and `contains-mcgill?`, both search a list of strings, differing only in the target string ("UBC" vs. "McGill").
      
2. **Introduce a New Abstract Function:**
    - Take one copy of the repetitive code.
    - Give it a more general name (e.g., `contains?`).
    - Add parameters for each point of variance (e.g., a parameter `s` for the string to search for).
    - Use these new parameters in the function body where the code originally varied.
      
3. **Replace Specific Code:** Rewrite the original specific functions/expressions to call the new abstract function, passing the varying parts as arguments.
    - _Example (`contains?`):_
        
        ```Scheme
        ;; Abstract function
        (define (contains? s los)
          (cond [(empty? los) false]
                [else (if (string=? (first los) s)
                          true
                          (contains? s (rest los)))]))
        
        ;; Original functions now use the abstract one
        (define (contains-ubc? los) (contains? "UBC" los))
        (define (contains-mcgill? los) (contains? "McGill" los))
        ```
        

**2. Higher-Order Functions: Functions as Data**

- Abstraction often leads to **higher-order functions** – functions that can:

	- Consume other functions as arguments.
    
	- Produce functions as results.
    
- _Example (`map2` - applies a function to each list element):_ If you have `(squares lon)` applying `sqr` to each element and `(square-roots lon)` applying `sqrt`, the function being applied is the point of variance.
    ```Scheme
    (define (map2 fn lon) ; 'fn' is a function parameter
      (cond [(empty? lon) empty]
            [else (cons (fn (first lon))
                        (map2 fn (rest lon)))]))
    
    (define (squares lon) (map2 sqr lon))
    (define (square-roots lon) (map2 sqrt lon))
    ```
    
    - The signature for `map2` would be `(X -> Y) (ListOf X) -> (ListOf Y)`, where `X` and `Y` are type parameters representing any type.
    

**3. Signatures for Abstract Functions**

- Signatures for abstract functions, especially higher-order ones, often use **type parameters** (like `X`, `Y`) to indicate that they can work with various data types. Determining these signatures sometimes involves working backwards from the function's body, identifying the types based on how parameters are used and what values are produced.

- For `(contains? s los)`: `String (ListOf String) -> Boolean`
- For `(map2 fn lon)`: `(X -> Y) (ListOf X) -> (ListOf Y)`
- For `(filter2 p lon)` (filters a list based on a predicate `p`): `(X -> Boolean) (ListOf X) -> (ListOf X)`

**4. Using Built-in Abstract Functions**

- Racket provides many powerful built-in abstract list functions like `map`, `filter`, `foldr`, `foldl`, `andmap` (checks if a predicate is true for all elements), `ormap` (checks if a predicate is true for at least one element), and `build-list`. It is good practice to use these when they fit the task, as they are efficient and well-tested.

- _Examples:_
    - `(define (wide-only loi) (filter wide? loi))` (where `wide?` is `Image -> Boolean`)
    - `(define (sum lon) (foldr + 0 lon))`

**5. Closures: Functions with "Memory"**

- **Context:** Sometimes, a function you want to pass to an abstract function (like `filter`) needs to access a variable from the scope where it's being _used_, not just where it's defined.
- **Mechanism:** Define the helper function _locally_ (using `local`) inside the outer function that has the needed variable as a parameter. The inner, local function "closes over" this variable from the outer function's environment.
- **"Function Factory":** This creates a specialized version of the inner function each time the outer function is called, with the closed-over variable's value fixed.
	- in the example below, every time `wider-than-only` is called with a different `w` parameter, we create a new version of the `wider-than?` function because it is a closure that uses `w`
- _Example (`wider-than-only` selects images wider than a given width `w`):_
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (wider-than-only w loi)
      (local [;; This local function 'wider-than?' closes over 'w'
              (define (wider-than? img) (> (image-width img) w))]
        (filter wider-than? loi))) ; Pass the specialized 'wider-than?' to filter
    ```
    
    Here, `wider-than?` cannot be a top-level function if it needs to use the `w` specific to each call of `wider-than-only`.

**6. Designing Abstract `fold` Functions from Templates**

- `fold` functions are a very general way to process recursive structures like lists or trees. 
- An abstract `fold` function can be derived directly from the data-driven template of a recursive data structure:

	1. Take the template for the data structure (e.g., `ListOfX`).
	2. Parameterize the parts of the template that would normally be filled in to create a specific function:
	    - The value for the base case(s).
	    - The function(s) used to combine the current element with the result of the recursive processing.

- _Example (deriving a `foldr`-like function from the `ListOfX` template):_ The `ListOfX` template is:
    
    ```Scheme
    ;; (define (fn-for-lox lox)
    ;;   (cond [(empty? lox) base-case-result]                         ; Parameterize this
    ;;         [else (combine-function (first lox)                     ; Parameterize this
    ;;                                (fn-for-lox (rest lox)))]))
    ```
    
    This leads to an abstract `fold` function:
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (my-foldr combine-fn base-val lox)
      (cond [(empty? lox) base-val]
            [else (combine-fn (first lox)
                              (my-foldr combine-fn base-val (rest lox)))]))
    ;; Signature: (Y X -> X) X (ListOf Y) -> X
    ```
    
    Many specific list operations can then be defined using this `my-foldr`:
    - `(define (sum lon) (my-foldr + 0 lon))`
    - `(define (product lon) (my-foldr * 1 lon))` This principle extends to more complex structures like arbitrary arity trees, where the `fold` function would take multiple combining functions corresponding to the different ways elements and sub-structures are processed.

- Abstraction allows for more general, reusable, and often more concise code by capturing common computational patterns.

### Complex Fold
- This details the design of a sophisticated abstract `fold` function specifically tailored for processing **arbitrary arity trees**. 
- These are tree structures where a node can have an arbitrary number of children, commonly represented by mutually recursive data definitions for an `Element` (a node in the tree) and a `ListOfElement` (the list of a node's children).

- The core idea is to generalize the traversal and computation logic inherent in the templates for these mutually recursive data structures.

**1. Starting Point: Templates for Mutually Recursive Data**

- The foundation for creating the `fold` function lies in the data-driven templates used to process `Element` and `ListOfElement`. These templates already encapsulate the necessary mutual recursion:

- The template for processing an `Element` typically accesses the element's direct data (like its name and some value) and then makes a call to process its list of children (`ListOfElement`).
  
- The template for processing a `ListOfElement` handles the base case (an empty list) and a recursive case that processes the first `Element` in the list and then the rest of the `ListOfElement`.

_Simplified Conceptual Templates:_

```Scheme
;; Template for processing an Element
(define (fn-for-element e)
  (... (elt-name e)
       (elt-data e)
       (fn-for-loe (elt-subs e)))) ; Processes the list of children

;; Template for processing a ListOfElement
(define (fn-for-loe loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) (...)]      ; Base case for empty list
        [else (... (fn-for-element (first loe)) ; Processes the first child (an Element)
                   (fn-for-loe (rest loe)))]))   ; Processes the rest of the children
```

**2. Parameterizing the Templates to Create `fold`**

- To create an abstract `fold` function, the specific processing steps (represented by `...` in the templates) are replaced with parameters. 
- These parameters will be functions supplied by the user of `fold`, defining how the tree's components should be combined.

- For an arbitrary arity tree (`Element` and `ListOfElement`), we identify three main points of parameterization:

	1. **`c1` (Element Combiner):** A function that defines how to combine an `Element`'s own properties (e.g., its name and data) with the already processed result of its children (the `ListOfElement`).
	2. **`c2` (List Element Combiner):** A function that defines how to combine the processed result of one `Element` in a list with the processed result of the rest of the `ListOfElement`.
	3. **`b` (Base Value for List):** The value to return when processing an empty `ListOfElement`.

**3. The `fold` Function for Arbitrary Arity Trees**

The resulting `fold` function uses `local` to define mutually recursive helper functions (derived from the original templates) that now use `c1`, `c2`, and `b` to perform their work.

```Scheme
(define (fold c1 c2 b initial-element)
  (local [;; Processes a single Element
          (define (process-element current-e)
            (c1 (elt-name current-e)            ; Use c1 to combine name, data,
                (elt-data current-e)            ; and processed children
                (process-loe (elt-subs current-e))))

          ;; Processes a ListOfElement
          (define (process-loe current-loe)
            (cond [(empty? current-loe) b]        ; Base case for list processing uses 'b'
                  [else (c2 (process-element (first current-loe)) ; Use c2 to combine processed first child
                              (process-loe (rest current-loe)))]))]   ; with processed rest of list

    (process-element initial-element))) ; Start processing with the initial element
```

_(This structure is based on the transformation shown in the PDF )_   

**4. Using the Complex `fold`**

To use this `fold`, you provide the three specific operations:

- `c1`: `(lambda (name data processed-subs-result) ...)` - How to make a result for one element.
- `c2`: `(lambda (processed-first-element-result processed-rest-of-list-result) ...)` - How to combine results within a list of elements.
- `b`: The value for an empty list of children.



```Scheme
(check-expect (local [; c1: String Int ListOfString -> ListOfString
					  (define (c1 n d s) (cons n s))
					  ; c2 : ListofString ListOfString -> ListOfString 
					  (define (c2 l1 l2) (append l1 l2))] 
					  ; b : listOfString
					  (fold c1 c2 empty D6))   
			  (cons "D6" (append (list "D4" "F1" "F2") (list "D5" "F3"))))
```

This would produce a result like `(cons "D6" (append (list "D4" "F1" "F2") (list "D5" "F3")))`.   

**5. Signature of the Complex `fold`**

The signature reflects the types of the combining functions and the overall operation:

If processing an `Element` produces a result of type `X`, and processing a `ListOfElement` (including the base case `b`) produces a result of type `Y`, then:

- `c1` (Element combiner): `String Integer Y -> X`
- `c2` (List combiner): `X Y -> Y`
- `b` (Base for empty list): `Y`
- `fold` (Overall): `(String Integer Y -> X) (X Y -> Y) Y Element -> X`   
    

This advanced `fold` function abstracts the common pattern of traversing and accumulating results over mutually recursive tree structures, allowing for concise and powerful data processing.

## Chapter 15

- This document introduces **generative recursion**, a style of recursion that differs significantly from the more common **structural recursion**. 
- Understanding this distinction is crucial, especially for proving that recursive functions will terminate.

**1. Structural vs. Generative Recursion**

- **Structural Recursion:**
    - In each recursive call, the function operates on a structurally smaller piece of the input data (e.g., the `rest` of a list, a child node of a tree).
    - The recursion's structure directly mirrors the self-referential data definition of the input.
    - Termination is generally guaranteed if the data structure is well-formed and finite because the function eventually reaches a base case of the data structure (e.g., an empty list, an empty tree).
    - _Examples:_ Processing all elements in a list, traversing all nodes in a file system tree defined by `Element` and `ListOfElement`.
      
- **Generative Recursion:**
    - In each recursive call, the function **generates new data** to be used as the argument(s) for the next call. These new arguments are not necessarily direct sub-components of the original input.
    - This approach is common in algorithms that create fractals, solve puzzles, or follow mathematical sequences where the next term is computed from the current one.
    - **Termination is not automatically guaranteed** by the structure of the input data. A separate argument is required to show that the sequence of generated problems will eventually reach a base case.

**2. Designing Functions with Generative Recursion**

The general pattern for a function using generative recursion involves:

1. **Trivial Case (Base Case):** A condition where the problem is simple enough to be solved directly, without further recursion.
2. **Non-Trivial Case (Recursive Step):**
    - The current problem data is used to **generate** a "next problem" (or multiple next problems).
    - The function calls itself recursively with this newly generated problem data.
    - The result of the recursive call(s) is then combined with other information from the current step to produce the final result.

- **Generic Template:**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (generative-recursive-fn current-problem-data)
      (cond
        [(trivial? current-problem-data) ; Check for base case
         (solve-trivial-case current-problem-data)] ; Direct solution
        [else ; Recursive step
         (... ; <combine>
           current-problem-data
           (generative-recursive-fn 
	           (generate-next-problem current-problem-data)))]))
    ```
    

**3. Examples of Generative Recursion**

- **Sierpinski Triangle (`stri` function):**
    
    - **Concept:** A Sierpinski triangle of size `s` is formed by an outer equilateral triangle of size `s`, with three smaller Sierpinski triangles of size `s/2` placed inside it.
    - **Base Case:** If the current size `d` is below a certain `CUTOFF`, draw a simple triangle.
    - **Generative Step:** For a size `d` above `CUTOFF`, the "next problem" generated for the recursive calls is a Sierpinski triangle of size `d/2`.
    - _Simplified `stri` function:_

        ```Scheme
        (define CUTOFF 20)
        (define (stri d)
          (cond
            [(<= d CUTOFF) (triangle d "outline" "red")] ; Base case
            [else (let ([sub-problem (stri (/ d 2))])   ; Recursive call with generated size d/2
                    (overlay (triangle d "outline" "red")
                             (above sub-problem
                                    (beside sub-problem sub-problem))))]))
        ```
        
- **Sierpinski Carpet (`ski-sq` function):** Similar fractal, but using squares and dividing the size by 3 in each recursive step to generate 8 sub-problems around a central empty square.
    
    ![Pasted image 20250515182058.png|200](/img/user/40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020250515182058.png)
    - Template:

```Scheme
;;TEMPLATE
(define (ski-sq d)
  (cond [(<= d BASE_CASE ) (... d)]
        [else
         (... d 
              (ski-sq (/ d 3)))]))
```

```scheme
;;Code the body

(define (rsq s) (square s "solid" "red"))

;;White square in the middle of a red square!
(define (ski-sq-base d) (overlay (wsq (/ d 3))
								   (rsq d)))
								   
;;
(define (ski-sq d)
  (cond [(<= d BASE_CASE ) (ski-sq-base 3)]
        [else
         (local [;;generate the next problem data by (/ d 3)
                 ;;solution (generative-recursive-fn ...) [EDGE]
                 ;; d is the current-problem-data used in MIDDLE
		         (define EDGE (ski-sq (/ d 3)))
                 (define MIDDLE (wsq (/ d 3)))]
           (above (beside EDGE EDGE EDGE)
                  (beside EDGE MIDDLE EDGE)
                  (beside EDGE EDGE EDGE)))]))
```

    
    
- **Collatz Conjecture (Hailstone Sequence `hailstones` function):**
    
    - **Concept:** A sequence starting from an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, stop. If `n` is even, the next number is `n/2`. If `n` is odd, the next number is `3n + 1`.
    - **Base Case:** When `n` becomes 1.
    - **Generative Step:** The next number in the sequence is _generated_ based on whether the current `n` is even or odd.
    - _`hailstones` function:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (hailstones n)
          (cond
            [(= n 1) (list 1)] ; Base case
            [else (cons n
                        (if (odd? n)
                            (hailstones (+ (* 3 n) 1)) ; Generate 3n+1
                            (hailstones (/ n 2))))]))    ; Generate n/2
        ```

Since termination is not guaranteed by the input data's structure, a **three-part termination argument** must be provided for functions using generative recursion:

1. **Base Case(s):** Clearly state the condition(s) under which the recursion stops without making further recursive calls.
    - _Example for `stri`:_ `(<= d CUTOFF)`
2. **Reduction Step (Problem Generation):** Describe how the arguments to the recursive call(s) are generated and how they relate to the current arguments. Show that the "problem" is, in some sense, getting "smaller" or closer to a base case.
    - _Example for `stri`:_ The argument to the recursive call is `(/ d 2)`.
3. **Argument for Convergence:** Explain why repeated application of the reduction step will inevitably lead to a state that satisfies a base case.
    - _Example for `stri`:_ If `d` starts positive and `CUTOFF` is positive, repeatedly dividing `d` by 2 will eventually make `d` less than or equal to `CUTOFF`.
    - _Note for Collatz/Hailstones:_ Proving termination for all positive integers is an unsolved mathematical problem (the Collatz Conjecture). Thus, a complete termination argument cannot currently be given for the `hailstones` function.

Generative recursion allows for solving a different class of problems than structural recursion, particularly those involving algorithms that create their own path toward a solution rather than just deconstructing input.


## Chapter 16

This document explores advanced search algorithm design, particularly backtracking generative search, illustrated through the complex example of a Sudoku solver. It also introduces lambda expressions as a way to simplify certain local function definitions.

**1. Lambda Expressions: Anonymous Functions**

Lambda expressions provide a way to create **anonymous functions** (functions without a name). They are useful for simplifying code where a locally defined function (`local`) is:

- Only used in one specific place.
    
- Has a body that is simple enough that giving it a formal name doesn't significantly improve code readability.
    
- **Syntax:** `(lambda (param1 param2 ...) body-expression)`
    
- **Replacing `local` with `lambda`:**
    
    - _With `local`:_
        
        ```Scheme
        (define (only-bigger threshold lon)
          (local [(define (pred n) (> n threshold))] ; Local named function
            (filter pred lon)))
        ```
        
    - _With `lambda`:_
        ```Scheme
        (define (only-bigger threshold lon)
          (filter (lambda (n) (> n threshold)) lon)) ; Anonymous function passed directly
        ```
        
    - Another example:
        - With `local`:
            ```Scheme
            (define (all-areas loi)
              (local [(define (area i) (* (image-width i) (image-height i)))]
                (map area loi)))
            ```
            
        - With `lambda`:
            ```Scheme
            (define (all-areas loi)
              (map (lambda (i) (* (image-width i) (image-height i))) loi))
            ```
            
- The `qsort` (Quicksort) example also demonstrates `lambda` for filtering elements less than or greater than a pivot:
    ```Scheme
    (define (qsort lon)
      (cond [(empty? lon) empty]
            [else
             (local [(define p (first lon))] ; Pivot
	             ; Pass (rest lon) to filter
               (append (qsort (filter (lambda (n) (< n p)) (rest lon))) 
                       (list p)
                       ; Pass (rest lon) to filter
                       (qsort (filter (lambda (n) (> n p)) (rest lon)))))])) 
    ```
    

**2. Designing a Backtracking Generative Search: Sudoku Solver Example**

- The core of the document is a detailed walkthrough of designing a Sudoku solver, which serves as an example of a complex search problem.

- **Sudoku Basics:** The goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers 1-9 such that no number is repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 box (unit).
    
- **Search Intuition (Generative Recursion and Backtracking):**
    
    1. Start with an initial (partially filled) Sudoku board.
		![Pasted image 20240101130826.png](/img/user/40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240101130826.png)
    2. **Generate Possibilities:** Find the first empty square on the board. For this square, generate 9 potential "next boards" by trying to fill it with each number from 1 to 9. This is a **generative recursion** step because new board states are created.
    3. **Prune Invalid Boards:** Some of these generated boards will be immediately invalid (violating Sudoku rules). Discard them.
       ![Pasted image 20240101131048.png](/img/user/40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240101131048.png)
    4. **Recurse:** For each valid "next board," repeat the process: find its first empty square, generate next boards, prune, and so on. This creates an arbitrary arity tree of board states.
       ![Pasted image 20240101131314.png](/img/user/40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020240101131314.png)
    5. **Backtracking:**
        - If a branch of the search leads to a board where no valid number can be placed in the next empty square (a dead end), that path is abandoned ("produce false"), and the search "backtracks" to a previous board state to try a different path (a different number in a previous empty square).
        - If a branch leads to a board that is completely filled and valid, that's a solution ("produce true" or the solved board).
          
- **Template Blending:** The design of the main `solve` function for Sudoku involves blending concepts from several templates:
    
    1. **Generative Recursion Template:** Because new board states are generated.
        - `trivial?`: Is the board solved? (`solved? bd`)
        - `trivial-answer`: The solved board itself.
        - `next-problem`: The list of valid next board configurations (`next-boards bd`).
          
    2. **Arbitrary Arity Tree Template (Mutual Reference):** Because each board can lead to multiple (0-9) next board states, implying a tree structure. This often leads to mutually recursive helper functions (e.g., one to solve a board, another to solve a list of potential next boards).
       
    3. **Backtracking Search Template:** To handle trying different paths and returning `false` on dead ends.
       
- **Simplified Structure of the `solve` function (illustrating blended concepts):**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (solve bd) ; Main entry point
      (local [;; Helper to solve a single board configuration
		      ;Generative Recursion
              (define (solve-board current-board)
                (cond
	              ; Base case: solution found
                  [(solved? current-board) current-board] 
                  ; Generate and solve next states
                  [else (solve-list-of-boards (next-boards current-board))])) 
    
              ;; Helper to iterate through a list of potential next boards
              (define (solve-list-of-boards list-of-boards)
                (cond
                  ; Base case: no more boards to try in this list, backtrack
                  [(empty? list-of-boards) false] 
                               ; Try solving the first board in the list
                  [else (let ([try-first (solve-board (first list-of-boards))]) 
                          (if (not (false? try-first))
                              try-first ; Solution found down this path
                              ; Else, backtrack and try next board in list
                              (solve-list-of-boards (rest list-of-boards))))]))] 
        (solve-board bd))) ; Initial call
    ```
    
    _(This structure combines generative (`next-boards`), mutual recursion (`solve-board` calls `solve-list-of-boards`), and backtracking (returning `false`, trying `rest`).)_
    
- **Wish List of Helper Functions:** The design of `solve` and its internal helpers (`solved?`, `next-boards`) leads to a "wish list" of further specialized helper functions:
    - `solved?`: `Board -> Boolean` (checks if a board is complete and valid).
    - `next-boards`: `Board -> (ListOf Board)` (generates valid next boards from the first empty square).
        - This itself might use function composition: `(keep-only-valid (fill-with-1-9 (find-blank bd) bd))`
    - `find-blank`: `Board -> Pos` (finds the position of the first empty square).
    - `fill-with-1-9`: `Pos Board -> (ListOf Board)` (fills a given position on a board with numbers 1-9 to create a list of boards).
    - `keep-only-valid`: `(ListOf Board) -> (ListOf Board)` (filters a list of boards, keeping only valid ones).
        - This would use a helper: `valid-board? : Board -> Boolean`.
    - `valid-board?`: `Board -> Boolean` (checks if a board has any row, column, or box violations).
        - This would further decompose into `check-rows`, `check-cols`, `check-boxes`.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Lambda expressions** offer a concise syntax for simple, single-use local functions, often used with higher-order functions like `map` and `filter`.
- **Generative recursion** is employed when the recursive calls operate on newly generated data rather than just sub-parts of the original input. This is common in search algorithms that explore a state space.
- **Backtracking** is a search technique where paths are explored, and if a path leads to a dead end, the algorithm "backtracks" to try alternative paths.
- **Template Blending** is a powerful design strategy where a function's structure is informed by multiple underlying patterns (e.g., generative recursion for creating states, mutual recursion for traversing a generated tree, and backtracking logic for navigating the search).
- Complex problems like Sudoku are tackled by breaking them down into smaller, manageable helper functions, often identified through a "wish list" process during the design.

This approach allows for the systematic design of sophisticated search algorithms by combining established design patterns and recipes.

## Chapter 17
- This document explores the use of **accumulators** in designing recursive functions in Racket. 
- Accumulators are extra parameters added to recursive helper functions to carry information across recursive calls. 
- They are primarily used for three main purposes: 
	- preserving context, 
	- enabling tail recursion by managing results, 
	- and enabling tail recursion by managing work-to-be-done.

**1. Context-Preserving Accumulators**

- **Problem:** Standard structural recursion sometimes "loses context." For example, when processing a list, the recursive call on `(rest lox)` doesn't inherently know the position of `(first lox)` within the _original_ list.
  
- **Solution:** An accumulator is introduced to explicitly carry this lost context (e.g., the current index) through the recursive calls.
  
- **Recipe:**
    1. Start with a standard structural recursive template for a helper function (often made local to a main calling function).
    2. Add an accumulator parameter to this helper. Define its type and interpretation (what it represents, e.g., "1-based index of the current element in the original list").
    3. The main function makes an initial call to the helper, providing the starting value for the accumulator.
    4. In the recursive step, use the accumulator's current value and update it appropriately for the next recursive call to maintain its meaning (invariant).
       
- _Example (`skipl` - select every other element, e.g., 1st, 3rd, 5th):_ The accumulator `idx` keeps track of the 1-based position in the original list.
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (skipl lox-initial)
      (local [;; idx : Natural - 1-based position of (first current-lox) in lox-initial
              (define (skip-helper current-lox idx)
                (cond [(empty? current-lox) empty]
                      [else (if (odd? idx)
                                (cons (first current-lox) 
				                        (skip-helper (rest current-lox) 
						                              (+ idx 1)))
                                (skip-helper (rest current-lox) 
			                                  (+ idx 1)))]))]
        (skip-helper lox-initial 1))) ; Initial call, index starts at 1
    ```
    

**2. Result-So-Far Accumulators (for Tail Recursion)**

- **Problem:** A recursive call is _not_ in "tail position" if its result is used in a further computation (e.g., `(+ (first lon) (sum (rest lon)))`). Such non-tail calls lead to a build-up of pending operations on the call stack, which can be inefficient for deep recursions.
- **Tail Recursion:** A function is tail-recursive if its recursive calls are in tail position (the very last operation performed). Tail-recursive functions can often be optimized by compilers to use constant stack space.
- **Solution:** Use an accumulator to build up the "result so far." Computations that would normally occur _after_ the recursive call are performed _before_ it, updating the accumulator.
- **Recipe:** 
    1. Use the accumulator template (outer function, local helper with accumulator).
    2. Move the computation that was pending around the non-tail recursive call into the accumulator argument for the new tail recursive call.
- _Example (`sum` of a list of numbers, tail-recursively):_ The accumulator `current-sum` holds the sum of elements processed so far.
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (sum lox-initial)
      (local [;; current-sum : Number - sum of elements seen so far
              (define (sum-helper current-lox current-sum)
		              ; Base case: return accumulated sum
                (cond [(empty? current-lox) current-sum] 
	                  ; Tail recursive call
                      [else (sum-helper (rest current-lox)
                                        (+ current-sum (first current-lox)))]))] 
        (sum-helper lox-initial 0))) ; Initial sum is 0
    ```

**3. Work-List Accumulators (for Tail Recursion in Complex/Branching Structures)**

- **Problem:** Achieving tail recursion for functions that traverse complex, branching data structures (like arbitrary arity trees, which often involve mutual recursion) can be difficult with just a "result-so-far" accumulator. 
	- **The natural recursive processing of multiple children of a node doesn't easily translate to a single tail call.** (we lost it as shown below!)
		- That's why we can't process the rest of the list now.!
	-  We will try to keep every single mutual recursive call at tail position

```scheme
;; Let's structure the code in tail form.
(define (count w)          
  (local [(define (fn-for-wiz w acc)
            ( ;... acc
	          ;   (wiz-name w)
              ;   (wiz-house w)
                 (fn-for-low (wiz-kids w) (... acc))))
          (define (fn-for-low low acc)
            (cond [(empty? low) (... acc)]
                  [else
                   (    ;... acc 
	                   (fn-for-wiz (first low) (... acc))
                        ;(fn-for-low (rest low) (... acc)) ;; it seems we have lost natural recursion
                        )]))]
    (fn-for-wiz w ...)))
```

  
- **Solution:** Introduce a "work-list" (or "to-do list") accumulator.
	- It might be a good idea to process **the rest of the list**, `(rest low)` in `fn-for-wiz` function.
		- this is as if we are adding a new accumulator , we name it as `todo` !
	- This list maintains the parts of the data structure that still need to be processed. 
	- The function processes an item from the work-list, adds its children (if any) to the work-list, and then makes a tail call to process the new work-list.
  
- **Recipe (Conceptual for a tree):**
    1. The helper function takes the current work-list and a result-so-far accumulator.
    2. If the work-list is empty, the base case is reached; return the result-so-far.
    3. Otherwise, take the first item from the work-list. Process this item (e.g., update the result-so-far).
    4. Add its children to the _remaining_ work-list.
    5. Make a tail recursive call with the new work-list and updated result-so-far.
    
    ```Scheme
;; Let's let fn-for-wiz to process the rest of the list.
(define (count w)          
  (local [(define (fn-for-wiz w todo acc)
            (fn-for-low (append (wiz-kids w) todo) (... acc)))
          (define (fn-for-low low acc)
            (cond [(empty? low) (... acc)]
                  [else
	                (fn-for-wiz (first low) (rest low) (... acc))]))]
    (fn-for-wiz w empty ...))) ;; the first wizard doesn't have any todo children, so we pass empty
    ```

- _Example (`count` wizards in a tree, tail-recursively):_ `Wizard` struct: `(define-struct wiz (name house kids))`where `kids` is `(listof Wizard)`.

```scheme
;;1. TypeComment: Natural
;;2. Interp. The number of wizards seen so far
;;3. Examples
;;(fn-for-wiz Wk empty 0)
;;	(fn-for-low (list Wh Wi Wj) 1)
;;		(fn-for-wiz Wh (list Wi Wj) 1)
;;			(fn-for-low (list Wc Wd Wi Wj) 2)
;;				...
(define (count w)          
  (local [(define (fn-for-wiz w todo acc)
			 ;mutually recursive call at tail position
            (fn-for-low (append (wiz-kids w) todo) (+ 1 acc)))
          (define (fn-for-low low acc)
            (cond [(empty? low) acc]
                  [else
                    ;mutually recursive call at tail position
	                (fn-for-wiz (first low) (rest low) acc)]))]
    (fn-for-wiz w empty 0)))
```

  

- **Traversal Order:** The way children are added to the work-list (e.g., `(append (wiz-kids current-wiz) remaining-todo)` for depth-first vs. `(append remaining-todo (wiz-kids current-wiz))` for breadth-first) determines the tree traversal strategy.
	- if you process the `(wiz-kids current-wiz)` first, you go down, meaning **depth first**
	- if you process `todo` first , you go horizontal , this is **breadth first**
      
- **Context with Work-Lists:** If information from parent nodes is needed when processing children (a context-preserving need), the work-list items themselves can be made more complex (e.g., pairs of `(wizard-to-process parent-context)`) to carry this context along.

Accumulators are a versatile tool for enhancing recursive functions, allowing them to manage contextual information efficiently and to be structured for better performance through tail recursion, even for complex data traversals.


## Chapter 18
This document introduces **graphs** as data structures, highlighting their differences from trees, methods for their construction (especially cyclic graphs), and strategies for processing them, including how to handle cycles using accumulators.

**1. Understanding Graphs**

- **Definition:** A graph consists of a set of **nodes** (or vertices) and **edges** (or arrows) that connect these nodes. In a **directed graph**, edges have a direction (e.g., a path from node A to node B doesn't necessarily mean a path from B to A).
  
- **Key Differences from Trees:**
    1. **Cycles:** Graphs can contain **cycles**, which are paths that start and end at the same node without repeating other nodes along the path. Trees, by definition, are acyclic.
        - _Example of a cycle:_ A -> B -> A.
          
    2. **Multiple Paths to a Node:** In a graph, multiple distinct paths (or multiple edges from different nodes) can lead to the same node. In a tree, each node (except the root) has exactly one parent and one path from the root.
       
- **Acyclic Graph:** A graph that does not contain any cycles.

**2. Representing Graphs and Constructing Cyclic Data**

To represent a graph in Racket, each node (e.g., a "room" in a mysterious house) can be a structure containing its name and a list of its direct "exits" (connections to other room nodes).

- **Data Definition (Example: `Room`):**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define-struct room (name exits))
    ;; Room is (make-room String (listof Room))
    ;; interp. A room with a 'name' and a list of 'exits' (other Rooms it leads to).
    ```
    
- **The Challenge of Cycles:** Directly defining cyclic data using standard nested `make-room` calls is impossible because it would lead to an infinite definition (e.g., if Room A leads to Room B, and Room B leads back to Room A).
  
- **Solution (`shared` Expression):** Racket provides the `shared` special form to construct data structures that contain cycles or where multiple parts of the structure refer to the exact same instance of another part.
    - **Syntax (Conceptual):** `(shared ([label1 definition1] [label2 definition2] ...) expression-to-return)` Within `definition1`, etc., you can refer to `label1`, `label2` even before they are fully defined, allowing for cycles.
    - _Example: Two rooms A and B, where A leads to B, and B leads to A._
        
        ```Scheme
        (define H2-cyclic-rooms
          (shared ([-A- (make-room "A" (list -B-))]  ; Room A leads to B (placeholder -B-)
                   [-B- (make-room "B" (list -A-))]) ; Room B leads to A (placeholder -A-)
            -A-)) ; The value of H2-cyclic-rooms is the structure starting with room A
        ```
        

**3. Processing Graphs: Templates and Handling Cycles**

Designing functions to operate on graphs requires careful handling of their structure, especially cycles, to prevent infinite recursion. The template for graph traversal often combines:

- Mutual recursion (e.g., one function to process a node, another to process a list of its neighbors/exits).
    
- A **work-list accumulator** (`todo`) to keep track of nodes yet to be visited (similar to breadth-first or depth-first search).
    
- A **context-preserving accumulator** (`traversed` or `visited`) to store the names (or identifiers) of nodes already visited. This is crucial to detect and avoid re-processing nodes in a cycle, thus preventing infinite loops.
    
- **General Template for Graph Traversal:**
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (fn-for-graph-node initial-node)
      (local [;; Processes a single node from the graph
              ;; current-node: the node currently being examined
              ;; todo-list: (listof Node) - other nodes queued for visiting
              ;; visited-nodes: (listof String) - names of nodes already processed to avoid cycles
              (define (process-node current-node todo-list visited-nodes)
                (if (member (room-name current-node) visited-nodes) ; Already visited?
                    (process-node-list todo-list visited-nodes) ; Yes, so skip and process next in todo
                    ;; No, not visited yet:
                    (process-node-list
                      (append (room-exits current-node) todo-list) ; Add its exits to the work-list
                      (cons (room-name current-node) visited-nodes)))) ; Mark as visited and process work-list
    
              ;; Processes the list of nodes to be visited (the work-list)
              (define (process-node-list current-todo-list visited-nodes)
                (cond [(empty? current-todo-list) (...)] ; Base case: work-list is empty. Result depends on task.
                      [else (process-node (first current-todo-list)
                                          (rest current-todo-list)
                                          visited-nodes)]))]
        ;; Initial call: start with the initial-node, empty todo list (beyond its exits), and empty visited list
        (process-node initial-node empty empty)))
    ```
    
    The `(...)` in the base case of `process-node-list` depends on what the function is trying to achieve (e.g., return `false` for a search, or return the accumulated `visited-nodes`).
    

**4. Example: `reachable?` Function**

This function determines if a room with a specific name is reachable from a starting room in a graph.

- **Signature:** `Room String -> Boolean`
- **Logic:** It uses the graph traversal template.
    - The `process-node` function checks if the `(room-name current-node)` matches the `target-name`. If so, it returns `true`.
    - If the `current-node` has already been `visited-names`, it continues by processing the `todo-list` (effectively backtracking or avoiding a cycle).
    - Otherwise, it adds the `current-node`'s exits to the `todo-list`, marks the `current-node` as visited, and proceeds.
    - The `process-node-list` returns `false` if the `current-todo-list` becomes empty (meaning the target was not found along any path).
- _Simplified Body Structure:_
    
    ```Scheme
    (define (reachable? start-room target-name)
      (local [(define (process-node current-r todo visited)
                (cond [(string=? (room-name current-r) target-name) true]
                      [(member (room-name current-r) visited) (process-lor todo visited)]
                      [else (process-lor (append (room-exits current-r) todo)
                                         (cons (room-name current-r) visited))]))
              (define (process-lor lor visited)
                (cond [(empty? lor) false]
                      [else (process-node (first lor) (rest lor) visited)]))]
        (process-node start-room empty empty)))
    ```
    

- Graph processing often requires managing a list of nodes to visit and a list of already visited nodes to handle the complexities introduced by cycles and shared structures effectively.
