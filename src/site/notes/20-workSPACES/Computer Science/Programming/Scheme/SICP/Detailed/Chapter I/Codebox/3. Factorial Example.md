# 3. Factorial Example

## Naive Recursive Implementation

### Code

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (factorial n)
  (if (< n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```
### Trace

```Scheme
(factorial 4) 
(* 4 (factorial 3)) 
(* 4 (* 3 (factorial 2))) 
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (factorial 1)))) 
(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))) 
(* 4 (* 3 2)) 
(* 4 6) 
24
```

### Explanation

1. **Process Type:** This `factorial` function generates a **`Linear Recursive Process` **.
- The trace shows a chain of **`deferred operations`** (the multiplications like `* 4`, `* 3`, `* 2`). The function must wait for the result of the inner recursive call (`factorial (- n 1)`) before it can perform the multiplication. 
- This "waiting" is the hallmark described in **[!TIP] ①**: _"Her çağrı, bir sonraki adıma geçmeden önce bir 'ertelenmiş işlem' (`deferred operation`) biriktirir."_

2. **Space Usage:** This process exhibits **`Growing Space Usage (Often Linear)` ([!TIP] ② `Linear Recursive Process`{has_characteristic} `Growing Space Usage (Often Linear)`)**.
    
    - Each `deferred operation` requires memory to store its pending state. As `n` (in `(factorial n)`) increases, the chain of these deferred operations grows, leading to increased memory consumption, reflecting the idea that more "note paper" is needed for a longer list of pending jobs.
      
- **Contrast with Iterative Process:** This **`Linear Recursive Process` {differs_from} `Linear Iterative Process`([!TIP] ⑤)**.
    
    - An iterative process (as described in **[!TIP] ③ `Analysis: Processes Generated` {details} `Linear Iterative Process`**) would typically maintain its state in a fixed number of variables and wouldn't accumulate deferred operations, thus having **`Constant Space Usage` ([!TIP] ④ `Linear Iterative Process` {has_characteristic} `Constant Space Usage`)**. Our `factorial` is not iterative in its _process_ shape due to these pending multiplications.

### What exactly is this required space?
> [!QUESTION]
> - Where does this required space emanate from? 
> 	  - Does it emanate from the deferred multiplication operations?
> 	  - Does it emanate from the recursive calls?
> - What exactly requires space?

- We already know that the deferred operations `factorial` example are a direct consequence of the recursive call `(factorial (- n 1))` not being in a tail position.

- It's the **execution context** that needs to be preserved for each active recursive call that has a pending (deferred) operation.
- This context is typically stored in what's called a "stack frame" on the program's call stack.


- Let's break down what this context includes for each step of `(factorial 4)`:

	1. **Call: `(factorial 4)`**
	    - Evaluates to `(* 4 (factorial 3))`.
	    - **Space Required for this Frame:**
	        - **Recursive Call Information:** It needs to know that `(factorial 3)` has been called and it's waiting for its result.
	        - **Deferred Operation Data:** It must remember the value `4` (the `n` for this frame) and the operation `*` that needs to be applied to `4` and the result of `(factorial 3)`.
	        - **Return Address:** Where to go in the program after `(factorial 4)` itself completes.
	          
	2. **Call: `(factorial 3)` (called by `(factorial 4)`)**
	    - Evaluates to `(* 3 (factorial 2))`.
	    - **Space Required for this New Frame:**
	        - Recursive Call Information: Waiting for `(factorial 2)`.
	        - Deferred Operation Data: Must remember its `n`, which is `3`, and the pending `*` operation.
	        - Return Address: Where to return _within the computation of `(* 4 (factorial 3))`_ after `(factorial 3)` completes.
	          
	3. **Call: `(factorial 2)` (called by `(factorial 3)`)**
	    - Evaluates to `(* 2 (factorial 1))`.
	    - **Space Required for this New Frame:**
	        - Recursive Call Information: Waiting for `(factorial 1)`.
	        - Deferred Operation Data: Must remember its `n`, which is `2`, and the pending `*` operation.
	          
	4. **Call: `(factorial 1)` (called by `(factorial 2)`)**
	    - `(factorial 1)` is treated as a base case resolving to `1` (as your trace `(* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1)))` suggests was the outcome for `(factorial 1)`): 
		    - This particular call might not add much to the chain of _deferred multiplications_ if it itself doesn't defer another multiplication. 
		    - However, the call itself occupies a frame until it returns.

- The key is that **each time a recursive call is made AND there's an operation pending on its result, a new portion of memory (a stack frame) is used to store the information for that pending operation and the state of the current call.**

	- So, it's not just the "multiplication operations" in isolation, nor just the "recursive calls" in isolation.
	- It's the **combination**: each recursive call that is _not in tail position_ implies there's a "job left to do" (the deferred operation). To remember these jobs, their parameters, and where to resume, space is needed.
## Iterative Factorial
### Code
```scheme
#lang racket

(define (factorial n)
  ; Define an inner helper function 'fact-iter'
  (define (fact-iter result state)
    (cond [(<= state 1) result] ; Base case: If state is 1 or less, return the accumulated result
          [else (fact-iter (* result state) ; Recursive step: Call fact-iter again with...
                           (- state 1))]))  ; ...updated result and decremented state
  ; Initial call to the helper function
  (fact-iter 1 n)) ; Start with result = 1 and state = n
```

### Trace
```Scheme
(factorial 4) 
(fact-iter 1 4) 
(fact-iter 4 3)
(fact-iter 12 2)
(fact-iter 24 1) 
24
```

### Explanation
1. **Process Type:** This `factorial` implementation generates a **`Linear Iterative Process` ([!TIP] ③ `Analysis: Processes Generated` {details} `Linear Iterative Process`)**.
    
    - The trace shows that the state of the computation at any point is completely summarized by the current values of `result` and `state`. There are no pending or **`deferred operation`s** waiting to be executed later. Each step directly calculates the next state based on the current one. This matches Elara's description: _"O anda önemli olan sadece kilin mevcut şekli... tüm bilgi, o anki durumun kendisindedir ve bir sonraki dokunuşla güncellenir."_ (What matters at that moment is just the current shape of the clay... all information is in the current state itself and is updated with the next touch.)
      
2. **Space Usage:** This process exhibits **`Constant Space Usage` ([!TIP] ④ `Linear Iterative Process`{has_characteristic} `Constant Space Usage`)**.
    - Because there's no buildup of deferred operations, the amount of memory required to track the process's state (`result` and `state`) remains fixed, regardless of how large `n` is. This aligns with Elara's marathon runner analogy: _"yanında taşıması gereken bilgi yükü yarışın uzunluğuna göre artmaz."_ (The information load they need to carry doesn't increase with the length of the race.)
      
3. **Syntax vs. Process & Tail Recursion:** This is a key example where **`Recursive Procedure Syntax`{can_generate} `Iterative Process` {if} `Tail-Recursive Implementation exists` ([!TIP] ⑥)**.
    - The `fact-iter` function _is_ syntactically recursive (it calls itself). However, the recursive call `(fact-iter (* result state) (- state 1))` is the _very last_ operation performed in the `else` branch. There's nothing else to do after this call returns. This is a **`Tail-Recursive Implementation`** (or "tail call").
    - Racket implementations are designed to optimize tail calls. They can execute this code using a **`Linear Iterative Process`**, effectively reusing the same memory space (like Elara's artisan using the same workbench) for each step, instead of allocating new space for each call as a non-tail-recursive function would.
