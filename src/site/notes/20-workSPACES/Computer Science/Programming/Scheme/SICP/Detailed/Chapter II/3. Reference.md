# 3. Reference (R): Generate Targeted Retrieval Cues


**Overall Narrative:**

- **Problem (❓/💡):** Simple data types are insufficient for complex phenomena, leading to program clutter and inflexibility when dealing with multiple data representations or types.
- **Core Principle (📖):** Employ Data Abstraction (separating use from representation) and develop Generic Operations (procedures that work across different representations/types).
    - `[Problem: Data Complexity ❓/💡] - {requires} [High] - [Principle: Data Abstraction & Generic Ops 📖]`
- **Key Tools (⚙️/ℹ️):**
    - Pairs (`cons`, `car`, `cdr`) as basic "glue."
    - Closure Property for hierarchical structures (Lists, Trees).
    - Symbolic Data mechanisms (Quotation `’`, `eq?`).
    - Type Tags & Data-Directed Programming (Dispatch Tables, `apply-generic`).
    - Coercion & Type Hierarchies for cross-type operations.
      
- **Solutions (🏗️/▶️/🌐):**
    - Rational Numbers (basic data abstraction).
    - Sequence/Tree Manipulations, Picture Language (closure, conventional interfaces).
    - Symbolic Differentiation, Set Representations, Huffman Trees (symbolic data).
    - Complex Numbers (multiple representations via tags/DDP).
    - Generic Arithmetic & Symbolic Algebra (cross-type operations, coercion).
    - `[Principle: Data Abstraction & Generic Ops 📖] - {enable} [High] - [Solutions: Modular Data Systems 🏗️/🌐]`
      
- **Critical Analysis/Generalization (💡/🌐):**
    - Data Abstraction -> Modularity, Maintainability.
    - Closure -> Power in hierarchical data.
    - Conventional Interfaces -> Reusable, modular sequence processing.
    - Data-Directed Programming -> Additive, extensible systems.
    - Representational choices heavily impact efficiency (e.g., Sets: Θ(n) vs Θ(log n)).
    - Managing diverse type interactions (coercion, hierarchies) is complex but crucial for robust systems.

**Key P-P-S Nuggets by Section:**

1. **Data Abstraction (Sec 2.1):**
    
    - **P (❓):** Simple data for complex entities (e.g., rationals).
    - **Pr (📖):** Separate use (interface: `make-rat`, `numer`, `denom`) from representation (e.g., pairs).
    - **T (⚙️):** Selectors, constructors, `cons`/`car`/`cdr`.
    - **S (🏗️):** Rational number system.
    - **A (💡):** Abstraction barriers enhance modularity; data defined by operations.
    - **Heuristic (🎲):** Define interface before representation.
      
2. **Hierarchical Data & Closure (Sec 2.2):**
    
    - **P (❓):** Representing sequences & hierarchies.
    - **Pr (📖):** Closure Property (combinable results).
    - **T (⚙️):** Lists, Trees (built with `cons`), HOFs (`map`, `filter`, `accumulate`).
    - **S (🏗️/🌐):** List/Tree algorithms; Picture Language; Conventional Interfaces pattern.
    - **A (💡):** Modularity via conventional interfaces; Stratified Design.
    - **Heuristic (🎲):** Strive for closure; Use enumerate-map-filter-accumulate.
      
3. **Symbolic Data (Sec 2.3):**
    
    - **P (❓):** Handling non-numeric entities as data.
    - **Pr (📖):** Symbolic Data Manipulation (symbols as first-class data).
    - **T (⚙️):** Quotation (`'`), `eq?`, list structures for expressions.
    - **S (🏗️/🎲):** Symbolic differentiation; Set representations (unordered, ordered, tree); Huffman codes.
    - **A (💡):** Trade-offs in set representation efficiency; Power of symbolic computation.
    - **Heuristic (🎲):** Choose sparse/dense representations based on data.
      
4. **Multiple Representations (Sec 2.4):**
    
    - **P (❓):** Inflexibility of single representation; need for coexistence (e.g., complex numbers: rect/polar).
    - **Pr (📖):** Generic Ops via Type Tags; Data-Directed Programming (DDP).
    - **T (⚙️):** Type Tag system (`type-tag`, `contents`), Dispatch tables (`put`/`get`), `apply-generic`.
    - **S (🏗️):** Complex number system handling both rectangular and polar forms.
    - **A (💡):** DDP provides additivity, enhanced modularity.
    - **Heuristic (🎲):** Use type tags for multi-rep; Prefer DDP for additivity.
      
5. **Generic Operations Systems (Sec 2.5):**
    
    - **P (❓):** Operations across different data types (e.g., int + rational + complex).
    - **Pr (📖):** Design of a unified Generic Arithmetic System.
    - **T (⚙️/💡):** Multi-level tagging, Coercion (coercion tables, `raise` op for type hierarchies).
    - **S (🏗️/🌐):** Generic Arithmetic Package (integrating Scheme nums, rationals, complexes); Symbolic Algebra (Polynomials with generic coefficients).
    - **A (💡/🌐):** Additive system benefits confirmed; Type interaction complexity (coercion limits, hierarchy limits) is a major challenge.
    - **Heuristic (🎲):** Implement coercion carefully, consider hierarchies.
